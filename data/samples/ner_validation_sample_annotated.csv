2016-12-23 11:40:00,"Mr Shoigu, I know that the operation to liberate Aleppo, this city of crucial importance for Syria, has ended. What is the situation now? Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu     Shoigu SergeiDefence Minister : The operation to liberate Aleppo was conducted in two stages.  The first stage was to liberate 115 districts, close to 82,000 square kilometres. Over this time, 7 humanitarian corridors were opened, enabling close to 110,000 people to leave the city, and 9,000 fighters laid down their arms. Most of them were amnestied in accordance with President Assads decision.  The second stage unfolded in the southern part of east Aleppo. This involved imposing a ceasefire since December 15 in order to carry out a massive humanitarian operation that saw the withdrawal from the city of radical fighters, together with their families, of women and children. This stage made it possible for us, together with our Turkish and Iranian colleagues and our colleagues from the Syrian authorities, of course, to organise the departure from the city of nearly 34,000 people over these days. Most of them, 14,000, are men, but there are also 8,500 children and a similar number of women.  A large group of Russian Armed Forces officers worked on this operation round the clock, monitoring all of the departure routes with the help of drones, and also web cameras at the entry and exit points. Seven command posts were set up in order to monitor the entire route the departing fighters and their family members travelled. The operation involved nearly 300 buses and 400 ambulances (380 ambulances, to be exact).  We tried to involve in this work all the groups present in the area: UN representatives and the various international organisations. The International Red Cross and the World Health Organisation were of greatest help during the operation, with close to 60 specialists taking part. The next equally important part has to do with mine clearing operations. In order to provide safe passage through these corridors we had to clear a number of areas of the mines planted by the militants. This was quite challenging considering the weather. The operation is complete, and I cannot fail to mention that it was carried out at your instruction and in close contact with our colleagues from Turkey and Iran. This should be followed by the next stage. In our opinion, we are close to reaching an agreement on a complete ceasefire across Syria. I can use this map to report on the progress in this operation. This is the remaining part, the one that was fully liberated by midnight last night. Demining units are currently working there since a lot of buildings have been abandoned and they pose a very serious threat to civilians returning here. Many people are returning to the other part of the city. Our specialists are working with their Syrian colleagues. In many neighbourhoods power and water supplies have been restored and humanitarian aid is being delivered. Unfortunately, while we have everything it takes to ensure this much talked-about humanitarian access, we do not see any willingness to do so. I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that we sent a military police battalion there last night to ensure order in the liberated areas. This ends my report. Thank you. Mr Shoigu, we are well aware that liberating Aleppo from radical groups is an important part of the efforts to fully normalise the situation in Syria, and hopefully, in the region in general. There is no question that this work, in particular at the concluding phase when we launched a humanitarian operation, was done with the direct involvement and even a decisive influence of our service personnel. In this respect, I ask you to pass on to them my best wishes and my thanks for their work, and the same for the Defence Ministry and General Staff heads.  Together with our partners from Iran and Turkey, and of course with the Syrian government, other countries in the region and all countries concerned, we will need to continue efforts to achieve a final settlement. We must make the greatest effort now to end hostilities everywhere in Syria, and we will, at least, do our sincerest best to achieve this goal.  Thank you very much.  This is an important part of the work given that this kind of non-military action, humanitarian swaps, can raise the level of trust between the parties to the conflict. This in turn creates conditions for strengthening the ceasefire regime, and so we will continue working in this direction.","[""Syria"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Russia"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Iran"", ""Turkey"", ""Syria"", ""Syria""]","[""Syria"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Russia"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Iran"", ""Turkey"", ""Syria"", ""Syria""]","[""Syria"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Russia"", ""UN"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Iran"", ""Turkey"", ""Syria"", ""Syria""]","[""Syria"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Russia"", ""UN"", ""International Red Cross"", ""World Health Organisation"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Iran"", ""Turkey"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Syria""]","""Syria"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Russia"", ""Turkey"", ""Iran"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Syria"", ""Iran"", ""Turkey"", ""Syria"", ""Syria""]"
2019-09-17 17:45:00,"Hello, colleagues, This year we have more than once discussed the situation in the Irkutsk Region where two flooding disasters occurred, one right after the other, including on site, often directly with local residents. Meanwhile, large natural disasters also affected other regions, primarily in the Far East. In attendance today are the heads of the Amur and the Jewish Autonomous regions and the Khabarovsk Territory. The Trans-Baikal Territory, the Magadan Region and the Republic of Buryatia, which were affected by flooding earlier, are staying connected. Situation reports indicate that we have in general passed the peak of the flooding; lets hope for that. Towns and buildings are gradually emerging from the water. The pre-emptive measures taken after the massive 2013 flooding helped avoid certain tragic and critical consequences. The National Crisis Management Centre of the Russian Emergencies Ministry has been effective. However, there are no final data on the damage, the number of households, enterprises or infrastructure facilities affected. Dozens of towns, villages, and several hundred residential houses remain flooded. This is why I would like to stress the first and key matter: people cannot be left alone to face these problems. Everyone  I want to say that I have said this a number of times but I will emphasise it again  everyone who suffered as a result of the flooding must receive support, must be informed of their rights and the allowances they are entitled to under the law; they must be able to get this assistance immediately and must know where to apply for it. Unfortunately, this is not always happening.  People still encounter callousness and red tape, which are all too common in our bureaucracy. I ask you to properly instruct your subordinates to conduct this work responsibly and consistently. And ask the heads of the regions to personally visit the affected areas without delegating this to anybody else so as to see the situation with their own eyes, to talk to the people and understand what needs to be done. Second, housing. This is the most serious and sensitive issue for everyone who had to leave their homes, while autumn and winter are almost upon us. Our task is to provide assistance quickly and efficiently and to address housing issues as soon as possible, considering the approaching colds. Third is to provide support to the elderly and lonely people as well as the disabled. We should not wait for their requests. The authorities must attend to everyone, find out what they need, help fill in the necessary documents and papers (or do it for them, if necessary), support, submit the documents where necessary and, most importantly, control all this and see that the work is done. Do not just forget about these papers, but see this through. Of course, the focus must also be on children; they must have everything they need: a place at school or kindergarten; and comfortable transport is also necessary if children have to go to a different school. Next, we have to restore energy and road infrastructure facilities and transport and normalise the operation of residential utility services as soon as possible. I am not even mentioning healthcare services, which must remain high quality and accessible regardless of the institution people turn to: whether its based on their place of residence or not. Of course, we must evaluate the damage to businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises and farms. On the whole, today I am asking you to report briefly and clearly on the developments, to provide an analysis of the current situation and the necessary measures: what additional assistance the federal authorities or the government needs to provide and what the immediate needs and problems are. I have to bring your attention to the fact that, according to incoming information, so far the disaster relief operations at the regional and local levels are not always carried out quickly or relevantly to the problems people face. This includes housing inspections and compiling the lists of victims. This makes it impossible to organise assistance or determine the size of federal support. We have no information on these critical issues to organise the work so far. No information yet. We continue to receive requests, but there are no documents or grounds for these requests. How can we make any decisions without documentation? Why are you stalling? Let me remind you that the heads of the regions and municipalities are directly responsible for this. Lets discuss these issues.  <>","[""Russia""]","[""Russia""]","[""Russia""]","[""Russia""]","[""Russia""]"
2012-05-25 20:30:00,"Good evening, colleagues, Mr Medvedev and I have asked everyone to get together today, including the former ministers, some of whom have moved to the Presidential Executive Office today, and the newly appointed top officials of the Russian Federation. By holding such a meeting we would like to emphasise that many of you know each other well and have been working together for many years, while some of you are new. In recent years, and I dont just mean the past four years but the period before that as well, we have been able to build team spirit and work together in the interests of the country and its development. Mr Medvedev and I would very much like to see that team spirit preserved. Each of you has your own job, I want to stress this, your own sphere, but we believe that the people who have gathered here are all experienced, friendly and considerate towards each other and, sharing a high sense of responsibility for the job you have been entrusted, and each of you is entitled to feel your colleagues support and know that they have your back. We want to make sure that you are all set to start joint, productive and efficient efforts in the interests of Russia.","[""Russian Federation"", ""Russia""]","[""Russia"", ""Russia""]","[""Russia"", ""Russia""]","[""Russia"", ""Russia""]","[""Russia"", ""Russia""]"
2014-11-07 19:20:00,"Ladies and gentlemen, This visit by the Peruvian head of state to Russia is the first such event at this level in the 140 years of our bilateral relations and the 45 years of diplomatic relations between our countries. We are marking both of these anniversaries this year. The talks with President Humala were constructive and friendly in spirit. I am sure that the agreements reached will give a big impetus to developing our bilateral ties. We discussed current bilateral and international matters and outlined our plans for further developing our political dialogue and our partnership in all areas. We paid great attention to the matter of expanding our trade and economic cooperation. We have already achieved some results in this area. Our bilateral trade has increased 2.5-fold over the last 5 years. Mr Humala and I think that it should be possible to double our reciprocal trade over the coming years. This requires us to improve the quality of our trade ties structure and encourage investment flows. Let me note that new opportunities are opening up now for increasing supplies of seafood, fruit, fish and other agricultural goods from Peru.  We instructed our intergovernmental commission to be more active in promoting big projects in promising areas such as mining, the energy sector, the automotive industry, and air and rail transport. We have already made some good progress in developing natural resources. A Peruvian business with Russian capital is involved in copper mining in Ica Department in Peru. They are using the very latest environmental standards. The importance that both countries place on environmental protection is reflected in the agreement on cooperation in this area that we signed today. Our countries also have big plans for industrial cooperation. Our KAMAZ company is taking part in setting up a joint venture for bus assembly. AvtoVAZ has good positions on the Peruvian market and exports the Lada car there. Russian Helicopters is selling Mi and Ka helicopters in Peru, and United Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation is holding talks on supplying aircraft for civil aviation.  Power Machines company has presented interesting proposals for turnkey supply of equipment for several Peruvian hydroelectric plants. Inter RAO is studying the opportunities for joining projects to build new power stations. We are also ready to make available our experience and modern technology for plans to develop nuclear energy, nuclear science and medicine in Peru.  We see good prospects in telecommunications and space exploration, including satellite communications and navigation. Russian specialists took part in placing in orbit in August this year Perus first micro-satellite, Chasqui-1. Two more small satellites are also in the plans. Russian companies are developing 4G broadband mobile internet in Peru and we are studying the possibilities for joint use of Russias global navigation system, GLONASS. Our bilateral humanitarian exchanges are developing rapidly. We make 30 scholarships available every year for Peruvian citizens to study in Russian universities. We currently have 117 Peruvian students studying free of charge in Russia. Tours by performers from the St Petersburg State Ballet on Ice, Rosgostsirk (Russian State Circus Company) performers and other groups were a great success in Peru. The exhibition 1,000 Years of Inca Gold met with great interest in its turn from people here.  Our countries have had visa-free travel since 2011. This helps to develop our humanitarian contacts and business ties. We would like to develop tourism too. The agreement on cooperation in this sector will give a good boost to this work, I hope. We also discussed international matters during our talks. With the APEC summit coming up soon in Beijing, we discussed Russia and Perus cooperation within this forum. Russia is interested in working together with integration organisations in the Latin American region. I am happy to say that our exchange of views confirmed our close positions on many of the most important issues on the global agenda. Taking this into account, we agreed to coordinate more closely our efforts on the international stage.  We discussed our work together on combating drug trafficking. We have a base for this work. Russian specialists are holding open courses for drugs control police from South America in Perus capital, Lima. 115 people from 9 different countries have already completed the courses.  I want to conclude by assessing these talks very highly. They demonstrated our mutual desire to continue developing our bilateral relations and our dialogue at all levels. I want to thank Mr Humala and his entire representative team for the work today and for all we have accomplished to develop our cooperation over this last period. Thank you for your attention.","[""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""USA"", ""Russia"", ""Peru""]","[""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Peru""]","[""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""APEC"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Latin America"", ""Russia"", ""South America"", ""Peru""]","[""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""APEC"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Latin America"", ""Russia"", ""South America"", ""Peru""]","[""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""Peru"", ""Russia"", ""USA"", ""Russia"", ""USA"", ""Peru""]"
2018-05-23 19:10:00,"Mr Titov, you have the annual report. Presidential Commissioner for Entrepreneurs"" Rights Boris Titov: Yes, Mr President, this is the fifth annual report. I would like to present it.  I must say that, like previous ones, it is based on the appeals that we receive. Over the past year, the number of appeals has increased by almost 23 percent. In addition, we hold meetings with the business community. There were over 80 meetings and situational analyses in the regions. And in Moscow we held 34 meetings on various issues. In addition, we carry out sociological research. Of course, the general conclusion to date is that the situation remains difficult. There are positive changes, for example, the growth in criminal prosecutions has slightly slowed down today, but we still cannot say that the problem has been solved. In addition, there is also administrative pressure on businesses. Unfortunately, businesses are still feeling this and are rather negative about this and about these trends. More than 80 percent said that administrative pressure remains high. But there is also positive change: for example, according to our studies, businesses are positive about the fact that corruption is going down and transparency of government procedures is getting better. However, at the same time, I must say that there are also other problems, and they are connected primarily with the economic conditions of doing business today. Just a second. We have already discussed some of these issues and even formulated the task of amending existing laws. In fact, the task of amending current legislation was assigned based on your suggestions. What is going on there? How far along are solutions to these issues? Do you remember what we discussed and how this was formulated? This is so, but we were also discussing other matters of a purely procedural nature, such as detention and so on. What about the extension of the time limit of the investigation? Sometimes the time limit is extended indefinitely. But you are referring to specific cases rather than a limited number of individuals. You also mention specific cases. We have talked about the need to introduce limits regarding extensions that are sometimes endless. What do you have to say on this matter? We need to understand whether this requirement is reasonable. As for endless extensions, I think that we need to go back. I sought advice from the President of the Supreme Court and the Prosecutor General before supporting your proposal. The heads of the main agencies in charge of citizen rights largely agree with you. So let us get back to this approach. I would ask you to come back to this and formulate your proposal again, and work on this, would you? Do the regional commissions make such decisions? Fine. I agree with you. The recent tragedies have shown that much is still to be done to restore order in this sphere. Of course, it would be wise to draft the guidelines you have mentioned, which must be clear, transparent and effective. But given the rapid development of technology, these guidelines must also be flexible and subject to revision. This is my first point here. I agree with you on this. My second point is that we must certainly pay more attention to the fire service. It would be reasonable to think about increasing the number of personnel, or at least bringing it up to the previously proposed standards. We must also provide new technology. This is a comprehensive task. Please, formulate your proposals, and we will work on them together.  <>",[],[],[],[],[]
2017-08-24 15:20:00,"Vladimir Putin discussed with the Acting Governor the complaints that came in from the regions residents during the Direct Line with the President and the current situation in the region, in particular, the state of roads, transport accessibility, provision of gas supply in rural areas, relocating people from dilapidated housing, and the situation in the regions healthcare sector.

2016-12-27 13:15:00,"Good afternoon, colleagues. Can you see and hear us well? My congratulations to you and everybody who is there at the site which I hope will be symbolic for a long time  that is, symbolic for all the aspects of energy supply to Crimea. Congratulations to Crimean residents, construction workers and everybody who has been involved in such a momentous and essential project for the entire country and the Crimean Peninsula. This is another significant step in the long-term development of Crimea. Supply of the Russian gas to the peninsula via the main pipeline will create a completely different environment for the whole economy sector, recreational industry and social sphere in Crimea and Sevastopol. As you know, we have already laid one power bridge this year, and the peninsula is being supplied with 800 megawatts of power. Todays event is another very significant and momentous step in the development of the Crimean Peninsula. In the very near future, in 20172018, two power plants will be built with a capacity of 470 MW each, using the gas delivered to Crimea, and they will cover all the current needs, with a surplus, and will set up a potential for developing the economy and the social sphere in Crimea and Sevastopol. In the coming four years, 70 kilometres of main gas pipelines with 2,500 connecting pipelines between the townships will be built and reconstructed, along with eight gas transmission stations. It is important  and its good that both Crimeas and Sevastopol leaders are here in the Kremlin now  it is important that the regional authorities and local councils should arrange timely and coordinated work on branching the gas systems, so that natural gas could reach the end consumer, households, our citizens residing in Crimea and Sevastopol. I would like to express special gratitude to the engineers and builders: to the engineers, as this was indeed a challenging engineering task, and to the workers, because they did everything on time and with good quality. By the way, this is the same construction company that is also building the Crimean bridge. I consider this the first step in the implementation of a whole range of tasks facing the builders. Congratulations again on this event! Please. Go ahead, please. Mr Shabanov, colleagues, friends, Let me congratulate you again. I expect the work will not be finished today. As I have already said, the regional authorities and we will do everything necessary to ensure that the gas reaches the end consumer as soon as possible. You know about the plans for branching on the southern coast of Crimea, however, this is just the first step. Everything should be done according to the plan, on schedule and with high quality. Thank you very much.

2019-01-17 19:30:00,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to thank President Vucic for inviting me on an official visit to Serbia. President Vucic and I maintain regular working contacts. Only recently, in October of last year, we held useful and constructive talks in Moscow. Before that in May, Mr Vucic came to Moscow for the celebrations of the 73rd anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War. He also joined the Immortal Regiment march in Red Square, holding up a photograph of his grandfather. I remember our visit to Belgrade in 2014 for the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the citys liberation from the Nazis. I remember the warmth and hospitality of our Serbian friends. Today we discussed in detail the entire range of bilateral relations and exchanged opinions on current international and regional affairs in the same partnership-based and constructive way. Both sides confirmed their intention to continue the development of multifaceted Russian-Serbian strategic partnership in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation, which is traditional for our countries and peoples. Of course, special attention was paid to trade and investment cooperation and interaction. Mutual trade continues to increase: it grew by 2 percent in the 11 months of 2018 (it was 23 percent in 2017 and now it gained two more percent) and reached almost $2 billion. The Russia-Serbia Intergovernmental Committee for Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation is conducting a large-scale job to improve our bilateral economic partnership. The committees co-chairs delivered reports today at the expanded meeting. Contacts between the countries industrial and agricultural enterprises, as well as business circles and scientific communities are being maintained. We also agreed that at its next meeting in the first quarter of this year the Committee will discuss matters concerning the practical implementation of the agreements reached today. In our common opinion, additional opportunities for the expansion and diversification of commodity flows will become available after the conclusion of an agreement on a free trade zone between Serbia and the Eurasian Economic Union. Belgrade has recently hosted another series of consultations. We expect the document to be signed before the end of the year. Energy is a key area of Russian-Serbian cooperation. Russian natural gas exports to Serbia grew by 20 percent and reached 2.3 billion cubic metres in 2018. By 2022, Gazprom plans to increase deliveries to 3.5 billion cubic metres. To that end, in 2019 a project will be launched to increase the capacity of the Banatski Dvor underground gas storage facility in Serbia from 450 million cubic metres to 750 million. Work will also continue to expand the Serbian gas transportation network. These measures will significantly improve the energy security of Serbia and the entire Balkan region. As the leading Russian investor in the Serbian energy sector, who invested about $3 billion in its subsidiary NIS Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), Gazprom Neft is planning to invest another $1.4 billion by 2025. NIS is currently Serbias largest taxpayer and one of the leading oil and gas corporations in Eastern Europe. Another Russian company, Power Machines, helped Serbia modernise the Iron Gate I hydroelectric power station, and continues to partake in the reconstruction of other power stations in Serbia. The realisation of joint plans in the sphere of peaceful use of nuclear energy reflected in the signed intergovernmental agreement would, without a doubt, give an additional impetus to the growth of Serbias economy. This agreement focuses on Serbias use of advanced Russian radiation technology in healthcare, industry, and agriculture. The company Russian Railways is making a significant contribution to the modernisation of Serbias railways. With the help of this Russian company, Serbia is now creating an up-to-date single dispatch centre, which will significantly increase the crossing capacity of the country""s transportation network. We also discussed the issues of defence and military technology cooperation with our Serbian partners. We will continue meeting the Serbian leadership halfway, contributing to improving Serbias defence capacity, further developing scientific and production cooperation with the countrys defence enterprises, and carrying on the practice of holding joint military exercises. We also paid attention to our dynamic cultural and humanitarian links. Serbia regularly hosts tours by Russian performers as well as cultural festivals. In February, this country will host large-scale events within the framework of Days of Russian Spiritual Culture. The project to decorate the interior of the Church of Saint Sava in Belgrade is currently being successfully implemented, as Mr President mentioned earlier. I am glad to have had the opportunity today to visit this church, which has special importance for Serbia, and meet with high representatives of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The understanding we have reached for Russia to return Page 166 of the Miroslav Gospel (an ancient Serbian Cyrillic manuscript), which is currently being held in the National Library of Russia, to Serbia and for Serbia to return Nicholas Roerichs paintings to Russia is a landmark event for the Russian-Serbian friendship. Mr President and I agreed for our culture ministers to work on the implementation of this exchange. And, of course, Russia cooperates and will continue to cooperate with Serbia in personnel training. This year 120 scholarships were allocated for Serbian students. The agenda of our talks also included topical international and regional issues. Russia, like Serbia, is interested in a stable and secure situation in the Balkans. In particular, Russias position on Kosovo is well known. We are in favour of reaching a viable and mutually acceptable agreement between Belgrade and Pristina on a Kosovo settlement based on UN Security Council Resolution 1244. Unfortunately, recently the Kosovo authorities have taken several prevocational steps, which have raised tensions significantly. I mean above all the announcement made by Kosovo on December 14 on the establishment of the Kosovo army. Of course, this is a direct violation of the resolution I mentioned, which does not allow for creating any military units except for the international UN forces. Russia completely shares the concerns of the Serbian leadership and people and understands that such irresponsible actions by the Kosovo authorities can result in destabilisation in the Balkans. In conclusion, I would like to say that our meeting was a success. I would like to once again express my gratitude to Mr President and all our Serbian colleagues for substantive and fruitful talks and thank all the people of Belgrade for welcoming the Russian delegation so warmly. I am sure that the agreements we reached today will further strengthen Russian-Serbian friendship. Thank you for your attention. With regard to the subject of energy, we are ready to implement projects to extend the TurkStream to European countries, to European consumers. Many are interested in this. We only need to arrange everything appropriately. We are ready and we have enough resources, as you know, more than enough. There are no problems at all. We are working with Serbia on this. This also applies to the development of infrastructure, including for transit across Serbia. We are ready to invest the necessary funds; they are estimated at $1.4 billion. We are preparing for this work, even actually starting it. But in the end everything will depend on other countries, including the EU countries, and how far they are willing to go to protect their sovereign national interests in the dialogue with European agencies. We once tried  we planned and launched work on the South Stream project. As you know, that project was discontinued through no fault of ours. Now Bulgaria, for example, is interested in extending TurkStream across Bulgaria and further on to Serbia, Hungary and so on. We are ready for this, and are even doing preparatory work, I repeat; we are ready to invest in it. Therefore, little depends on us here. We will do this; next week I will meet with visiting President Erdogan, and I know his position. Turkey is also positive about it, and is working towards this, eager to build relations with its partners in Europe and intends to do so. Therefore, we will start working and see what happens. As for whether our other large energy infrastructure project, Nord Stream 2, will get in the way of this project, I can assure you  absolutely not. Next week, the leadership of Gazprom will be in Brussels to discuss a number of cooperation matters, including, by the way, transit through Ukraine, taking into account the growing volume of supplies of our natural gas to Europe. Last year it hit a record high  over 200 billion cubic metres  and continues to grow. We will load not only Nord Stream legs, not only the TurkStream pipeline, but with this volume of supplies to European consumers, the possibility of continuing transit through Ukraine also remains. Regarding the mediation in the Kosovo peace process, Russia has always been actively involved in resolving these crises. As for direct mediation, we know, and Mr President also said that the EU was an intermediary in resolving a number of issues, but, unfortunately, few agreements are actually being fulfilled. For example, Serbian municipalities should have been created in Kosovo  they were not. Resolution 1244, which has already been mentioned, provides for the presence of Serbian police and even border guards in Kosovo. Where are they? They are not there. Therefore, it is necessary, it seems to me, to show more respect for international law, and only in this case can we achieve any fair solutions. Question (retranslated): A question for President Vucic. What comments would you make concerning the unusually great interest of the British and other media to Mr Putins visit? Do you expect that after this visit, the country will be put under pressure in order to spoil our relations with Russia? You already mentioned this, but do you think that Serbia can expect international support from Russia in the Kosovo issue? (Speaks Russian) And a question for the President of Russia. Mr President, I am sure you know that Serbia considers Russia one of its key and most important partners in the world, especially in solving such important international problems as Kosovo. You know, almost 80,000 people have gathered now near the Cathedral of Saint Sava, which you will visit soon. And as President Vucic said, they are waiting for you; they want to see you, greet you and hope to hear words of friendship and support, especially relating to Kosovo. What will you say to them? You know, there are no rallies planned for my visit, but I am very pleased to hear your words, however unexpected they might be. Therefore, I doubt I can say something there, especially without an interpreter. But here I can say that we greatly appreciate such examples of friendship, and value them very highly. As for our relations, I only can add that the relations between Russia and Serbia did not appear yesterday; they have deep and strong roots and date back centuries. The Russian and Serbian peoples have always been spiritually connected. I would like to mention a Serbian saying, which goes like this: If we are together, we will win. This is what I would like to say to those people on the square, and to everyone who wanted to hear Russias opinion. You just heard our opinion of what is going on in the region, including Kosovo. We consider the violation of the common rules of international law, in particular, Resolution No 1244, unfair and very dangerous. Of course, we will work together with all our partners to ensure that international law is observed and that decisions are just. We are monitoring the situation in the region. Sometimes it seems that the decisions made earlier were only made to disengage the Serbian people. And these decisions will unlikely be viable if they are not just, this is what I would like to emphasise.  Together  the Serbian party, Serbian leadership and President Vucic contribute to this a lot  we will have to convince all of our partners, if we want to reach stability in the regions, to be able to find compromises, and when they are found, we must stick to them.","[""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Bulgaria"", ""Bulgaria"", ""Serbia"", ""Hungary"", ""Turkey"", ""Ukraine"", ""Ukraine"", ""Russia"", ""UK"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia""]","[""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Kosovo"", ""Kosovo"", ""Kosovo"", ""Kosovo"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", Bulgaria, Bulgaria, ""Serbia"", Hungary, ""Turkey"", Ukraine, Ukraine, ""Kosovo"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Serbia"", ""Kosovo"", ""UK"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Kosovo"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia""]","[""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Kosovo"", ""UN"", ""Kosovo"", ""Kosovo"", ""Kosovo"", ""UN"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""EU"", ""Serbia"", ""Turkey"", ""Kosovo"", ""Russia"", ""EU"", ""Serbia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Serbia"", ""Kosovo"", ""UK"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Kosovo"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Kosovo"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia""]","[""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Eurasian Economic Union"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia"", ""Balkans"", ""Russia"", ""Serbia"", ""Serbia""]","[""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Turkey"", ""Ukraine"", ""Ukraine"", ""Russia"", ""UK"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""Russia""]"
2017-04-13 14:15:00,"Mr Zhang Gaoli, friends, Please accept my heartfelt greetings. This is not our first meeting. We have very good relations. These relations rest above all, of course, on the level of relations between our two countries and on the mutual interests and projects that you are working on together with your Russian colleagues. The business ties and implementation of projects that you are involved in are greatly aided, of course, by the positive attitude in this respect taken by President of China Xi Jinping, with whom we have very good, friendly relations. I would like to ask you to pass on my warm and sincere greetings. I plan to take part, at the Chinese Presidents invitation, in the One Belt  One Road international forum and to make a working visit to Beijing for this occasion. I know that you are working actively to prepare this event.  Welcome! First Vice Premier of the State Council of China Zhang Gaoli     Zhang GaoliFirst Vice Premier of the State Council of China  (retranslated): Your Excellency, Mr President, I am very grateful to you for finding the time to meet with me and my delegation despite your busy schedule. You noted rightly that this is not our first meeting. Each meeting leaves me with deep and unforgettable impressions. I treasure greatly the gift with the Power of Siberia logo and the jacket that you gave me in Yakutsk. Mr President, you are a long-time great friend of China. Allow me to convey President Xi Jinpings warmest greetings and best wishes. I will personally pass on your warm greetings to President Xi. You have met with President Xi more than 20 times now, and this deep personal friendship and common agreements and decisions between the two leaders serve as a strategic guideline for developing Russian-Chinese relations. We know that a serious terrorist attack, an explosion, took place in the St Petersburg metro on April 3, resulting in many victims. China has already firmly condemned this terrorist attack. Let me take this opportunity to once again express our condolences to the injured and to the families and loved ones of all of those killed. China will continue to fight international terrorism with Russia and other members of the international community in order to preserve peace and stability around the world. Your personal efforts, Mr President, and those of President Xi set the strategic direction and constantly advance the friendship and cooperation between our countries, setting new tasks and directions and producing new results.  President Xi and the Chinese Government place great importance on your upcoming participation in the One Belt  One Road international cooperation forum in Beijing in May. President Xi will visit Russia in July. The main aim of my visit to Russia is to prepare the upcoming bilateral summits. During this visit, I have already held the fourth meeting of the Investment Cooperation Commission. <>","[""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""Russia""]","[""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""Russia""]","[""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""Russia""]","[""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""Russia"", ""China""]","[""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""China"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""China"", ""Russia"", ""Russia""]"
2016-04-11 17:25:00,"Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Allow me to welcome you in Moscow.  Your committee [the Eastern Committee of the German Economy] has always been very active in maintaining Russian-German trade and economic ties, and you continue this work today, despite the current difficulties we are facing.  There have always been difficulties of some kind, but even during the deepest Cold War years, Russia, or the Soviet Union as it was then, and Germany always maintained and developed trade and economic relations and carried out major projects, including a most symbolic one  the gas in exchange for pipes project.  Our cooperation is far more diversified today and more extensive in geographical spread and the range of sectors it covers. It looks completely different today compared to previous decades. Germany remains our second trade and economic partner in terms of trade turnover, with only China ahead as far as our trade relations with individual countries go.  We have many promising projects, and I hope that your interest in cooperation with Russia and with your Russian partners will only grow, and you will seize the opportunities our market offers. It would be foolish to put the cooperation and experience we have built up together through trials and risk losing the opportunities the Russian market offers.  For our part, we will do everything we can to provide the best possible conditions for our foreign partners, including German business representatives.
