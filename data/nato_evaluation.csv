8995;"Good afternoon, colleagues. We are meeting today to discuss the current developments in Donbass.  I will briefly remind you how it all started and how the situation has developed even though you know this very well. But we need general background to help us make appropriate decisions.  So, after the 2014 coup in Ukraine, part of the population did not accept the outcome. Let me remind you that this was an anti-constitutional, blood-shedding coup that killed many innocent people. It was truly an armed coup. Nobody can argue that.  Some of the country’s citizens did not accept the coup. They were residents of Crimea and the people who currently live in Donbass.  Those people declared that they were establishing two independent republics, the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic. This was the point when the confrontation started between the Kiev officials and the people living on that territory.  In this context, I would like to point out that Russia initially did everything it could to make sure these disagreements could be resolved by peaceful means. However, the Kiev officials have conducted two punitive operations on those territories and, apparently, we are witnessing a third escalation.  All these years – I want to stress this – all these years, the people living on those territories have been literally tortured by constant shelling and blockades. As you know, the people living on those territories, close to the front line, so to speak, were in fact forced to seek shelter in their basements – where they now live with their children.  A peace plan was drafted during the negotiating process called the Minsk Package of Measures because, as you recall, we met in the city of Minsk. But subsequent developments show that the Kiev authorities are not planning to implement it, and they have publicly said so many times at the top state level and at the level of Foreign Minister and Security Council Secretary. Overall, everyone understands that they are not planning to do anything with regard to this Minsk Package of Measures. Nevertheless, Russia has exerted efforts and still continues to make efforts to resolve all the complicated aspects and tragic developments by peaceful means, but we have what we have.  Our goal, the goal of today’s meeting is to listen to our colleagues and to outline future steps in this direction, considering the appeals by the leaders of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic on recognising their sovereignty, as well as a resolution by the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the same subject. The latter document urges the President to recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic. At the same time, I would like to note that these different matters are, nevertheless, closely linked with matters of maintaining international security, on the European continent in particular, because the use of Ukraine as a tool for confronting this country, Russia, of course, presents a major and serious threat to us. This is why we have intensified our work with our main partners in Washington and NATO over the past few months and in late 2021, so as to reach an eventual agreement on these security measures and to ensure the country’s calm and successful development under peaceful conditions. We see this as our number one objective and a top priority; instead of confrontation, we need to maintain security and ensure conditions for our development.  But we must, of course, understand the reality we live in. And, as I have said many times before, if Russia faces the threat of Ukraine being accepted into the North Atlantic Alliance, NATO, the threat against our country will increase because of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty that clearly states that all countries in the alliance must fight on the side of their co-member in the event of an aggression against it. But since nobody recognises the will expressed by the people of Crimea and Sevastopol, and Ukraine continues to insist that it is Ukrainian territory, there is a real threat that they will try to take back the territory they believe is theirs using military force. And they do say this in their documents, obviously. Then the entire North Atlantic Alliance will have to get involved.  As you know, we have been told that some NATO countries are against Ukraine becoming a member. However, despite their objections, in 2008, they signed a memorandum in Bucharest that opened the doors for Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO. I have not received an answer to my question as to why they did that. But if they took one step under pressure from the United States, who can guarantee that they will not take another step under pressure? There is no guarantee. There are no guarantees whatsoever because the United States is known to easily discard any agreements and documents it signs. Still, at least something must be put on paper and formulated as an international legal act. At this point, we cannot even agree on this one thing.  Therefore, I would like to suggest that we proceed as follows: first, I will give the floor to Mr Lavrov who is directly involved in the attempts to reach an agreement with Washington and Brussels, and with NATO, on security guarantees. Then I would like Mr Kozak to report on his findings concerning the talks on the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Then each of you will be able to speak. But at the end of the day, we must decide what we will do next and how we should proceed in view of the current situation and our assessment of these developments.  Mr Lavrov, please.  I am talking to my colleagues about this in fact, and my American colleague has assured me that they are not going to admit Ukraine tomorrow; moreover, even a moratorium is possible. But they also believe that Ukraine is not ready yet, so my answer was simple: “We do not see this as a concession to us; it is just the implementation of your plans. You believe you need to wait and prepare Ukraine for joining NATO. A moratorium, but not a moratorium for us; you are announcing this moratorium for yourself. So where is the step towards us, to meet us halfway? So far, we have not seen this.” I spoke twice to the President of France yesterday; actually, we spoke until 2 am this morning, so you could say we talked today. He insists that the US position has undergone some changes. But regrettably, he was unable to answer the question of what those changes are.  I think first we need to see what these changes are, if they exist at all, because your colleagues, to the contrary, publicly claimed as late as yesterday that there were no changes in the principal issues of expansion, of accepting new countries into NATO, including Ukraine. Do I understand it correctly?  I see, thank you. Take your seat, please, Thank you. Now, Mr Kozak will report – as I requested – on any developments on the Minsk settlement track, let us call it that. And after that, I would ask the other Security Council members to speak out starting with the real situation, which is now unfolding in the Donetsk People’s Republic.  Please, Mr Kozak.  No-no, please, tell us about the negotiating process on the Minsk agreements and its current status. As I have already mentioned, yesterday I spoke with my French counterpart once again. He claims that Ukraine’s incumbent leadership is ready to implement the Minsk agreements and is even introducing certain new constructive ideas on their implementation, such as an election under the arrangement used for the election of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier     Steinmeier Frank-WalterPresident of the Federal Republic of Germany . Meaning we don’t know what? We don’t know what provisions of the Minsk Agreements Donbass is not complying with. Please explain once again about Clauses 9, 11 and 12 stating expressly that decisions should be taken in dialogue with … During consultations and in dialogue with these republics. What do you have to say on this matter? Do you mean that, in their opinion, the provision reading “during dialogue and by agreement” does not mean direct dialogue? Do we understand you correctly thatthe Kiev authorities do not want to talk to the republics directly? They say they intend to do this in dialogue with Russia, but as soon as Russia suggests steps towards settlement as part of the Minsk Agreements, they throw a tantrum, claiming that Russia is interfering in Ukraine’s internal affairs? Yes. And what about [their claim] that the Minsk Agreements should be interpreted in such a way that it is the current Kiev official authorities, rather than the unrecognised republics, that should introduce initiatives and proposals on how to implement the Minsk Package of Measures? Do I understand you correctly that the key provision of the Minsk Agreements that all these amendments, including constitutional amendments, should be coordinated with the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, is being disregarded? Ok. Then I have what I can call a final question for this part. Tell me and our colleagues your opinion as to whether or not the Kiev authorities will implement the Minsk Agreements? Ok. Thank you, all right. Let us now confine ourselves to your remarks… Mr Kozak, we will confine ourselves to your remarks on the negotiating process within the framework of the Minsk Agreements and to your assessment of prospects. We have understood that, in your opinion, there are no prospects for the development of the negotiating process within the framework of the Minsk Agreements. Thank you.  (Addressing Alexander Bortnikov.) Now I would like to ask Director of the Federal Security Service, Mr Bortnikov, to report on the situation at the border, including with regard to border officers recording the number of people crossing our border, refugees, and on developments at the border.  Director of the Federal Security Service Alexander Bortnikov     Bortnikov AlexanderDirector of the Federal Security Service : Mr President, We can see that the situation is deteriorating in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics. We see that shelling is intensifying, threatening primarily the lives of civilians. Because of these circumstances, refugees have started moving towards the Russian border, and as of 9 am this morning, around 68,500 civilians had entered Russia from the DPR and LPR, according to statistics provided by the border service.  First, we are maintaining direct contact with representatives of the government bodies in the regions that are dealing with refugees.  Second, we can see that, as a result of intensified shelling by Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, there have been shells landing in the Russian Federation, first of all, in the Rostov Region. Given this circumstance, the Federal Security Service and the Russian Investigative Committee are carrying out the necessary operative investigative measures. Last night, two Ukrainian sabotage groups approached the border with Russia in the Lugansk region and Mariupol. As a result of the battle fought by our border troops, supported by the Defence Ministry, these two sabotage groups were destroyed. One military of the Ukrainian troops was captured. Further steps are being taken.  Overall, the situation at the border on our side is stable. We are monitoring the border and providing military reinforcements, including to the Border Service. We are working together with law enforcement agencies and the Defence Ministry.  Thank you. Mr Shoigu, I know that the Defence Ministry is monitoring the situation in the conflict zone. Please report. Thank you. Colleagues, I think we are all aware of the status of the negotiating process on the Donbass settlement. It has been described in sufficient detail by the Federal Security Service Director and the Defence Minister. We need to give an answer to the question that was raised a long time ago and is included in the State Duma’s appeal to the head of state. This question concerns recognising the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. We see the threats and blackmail coming from our Western colleagues, and we understand where this step stems from, but we understand the situation at hand as well. Mr Medvedev. Thank you. Mr Medvedev, and I want to say this to all of you now: each of you knows that I did not discuss anything with anyone in advance. I want to emphasise this. I did not ask for your opinion in advance. What is happening now is happening, so to say, unrehearsed, because I wanted to know what your opinion is without any prior preparation. I believe this to be very important, and I would like the State Duma Speaker to express his opinion on this issue.  Mr Volodin. Thank you. Ms Matviyenko. Thank you. Mr Patrushev. Thank you. Mr Mishustin. So, you support the appeal by the State Duma? Thank you. Mr Naryshkin. What does “otherwise” mean? Do you propose starting a negotiating process or recognising the sovereignty of the republics? Speak plainly. Will support or support? Speak plainly, Mr Naryshkin. Just say yes or no. We are not talking about this, we are not discussing this. We are talking about recognising their independence or not. Good. Please take your seat. Thank you. Mr Kolokoltsev. Thank you very much. Regarding the negotiating process, Mr Kozak reported it is at a dead end. We have been negotiating for eight years now. This is what we are talking about. All plenipotentiary envoys are present here. I would like to ask one of you, say, Mr Shchegolev, to speak out. Of course, I expect you to express your own position, but we will assume that our other colleagues adhere to approximately the same viewpoint. Should any envoy feel the need to add something and express their point of view, they are welcome to do so. Please, go ahead. Thank you. I would like to ask all those present here today, are there any other points of view or special opinions on this matter? None? I know the position of the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry, and the Federal Security Service. Nevertheless, I would like to hear what you have to say. Mr Lavrov, you have the floor. Thank you. Mr Shoigu. Thank you. Mr Zolotov. Fine. Thank you. Colleagues, I have heard your opinions. The decision will be made later today.   I would like to thank you for this meeting, for this conference.";2022;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;2769;YES;multiple times (short & long)
8993;"Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the President of the Republic of Belarus for accepting my invitation and coming to Moscow today. We understand that the President has a very busy schedule right now, in connection with the necessary preparations for an important domestic event: the upcoming nationwide referendum of the new version of the Belarusian Constitution on February 27. Of course, we wish our Belarusian friends success in holding it. Let me note that our talks today were held in a constructive, business-like and friendly atmosphere, like we have had for many, many years. As both sides have stressed many times, Russia and Belarus are good neighbours, close allies and strategic partners. We are deeply connected by a common history, moral values and family ties. Diverse bilateral cooperation is always built on the principles of mutual respect, support and consideration of each other’s interests. Of course, we have always paid and will pay special attention to the expansion of trade and economic ties. Despite the coronavirus-related difficulties, trade is growing: it increased by more than a third in 2021, or 34.4 percent, and amounted to a significant amount of US$38.5 billion. Almost half of all products manufactured in Belarus are exported to Russia, and Russia is a leading investor in the real sector of the Belarusian economy. Russian investment accounts for about 30 percent of total foreign investment in Belarus. And we will certainly try to create even more comfortable conditions for the business communities of the two countries and encourage entrepreneurial initiatives. Of course, matters related to building the Union State and promoting integration within it were among the central topics in our talks with the President of Belarus. We carefully studied the progress of implementing the strategic decisions approved at the November 4, 2021, meeting of the Union State Supreme State Council. We also discussed efforts to implement the 28 sectoral programmes of the Union and in general the provisions of the Treaty Establishing the Union State. During the talks, we noted that the 28 programmes we are talking about build on our long-standing cooperation and integration efforts in the relevant fields. Both sides noted that relevant agencies of Russia and Belarus have been working together effectively on promoting integration across the board. The high-level group for coordinating our integration cooperation has been gathering momentum. It held a regular meeting in mid-December. Our respective governments have also maintained close contact. Let me remind you that our prime ministers held eight meetings last year. In fact, they remain in touch constantly, almost on a weekly basis, if necessary.  Of course, Mr Lukashenko and I keep the implementation of integration-related process under our personal control. We can outline several areas where we have achieved tangible progress recently. In particular, in the transport and logistics sector there was a significant increase in transits of Belarusian exports in many categories across Russian territory to third countries. We will continue our consistent efforts to build a common freight and passenger market within the Union State. In the lending and financial sector, we have been cooperating to overcome and minimise the consequences of illegitimate sanctions imposed by some countries with a view to worsening the socioeconomic situation in our countries. In addition, we have been working on integrating our payment systems and creating a new payment framework, as well as harmonising tax, customs, and labour laws of the two countries, and unifying our markets in the gas, oil, petrochemical, and electric power sectors. I would like to note that our joint efforts to implement the economic agenda of the Union State are ultimately designed to ensure economic growth and to improve the living standards of our people. Our other major integration projects have the same goals. I am referring to the Eurasian Economic Union, in the framework of which we are creating a truly common Eurasian market for goods, services, capital and workforce. It is important that all EAEU member states feel the practical effects of these processes. During our talks today we had an in-depth discussion on strengthening the common defence space of Russia and Belarus. We have agreed to continue taking the necessary collective measures to ensure the security of our two states in light of the growing military activity of the NATO states on the external border of the Union State. In this context, we praised the Allied Resolve 2022 military exercises, the active phase of which will run until February 20 in Belarus. I would like to point out that these exercises are purely defensive and do not threaten anyone. As you know, the defence ministries of our two states in due time announced the essence and goals of these planned – I would like to emphasise this – planned manoeuvres. As the President of Belarus, who attended them, said today, many foreign representatives and military attachés are attending the exercises and can see the whole thing with their own eyes.  Responding to a request from President Lukashenko, I talked about my recent meetings with foreign leaders on the provision by the US and NATO of long-term and legally binding security guarantees for Russia. We believe it is both logical and understandable that this issue also concerns our Belarussian allies. We discussed the situation with Russia’s requests for the West, the most important of which concern NATO’s non-expansion, the non-deployment of strike weapons systems in close proximity to the Russian border, and the return of the bloc’s military potential and infrastructure in Europe to the state of 1997 when the Russia-NATO Founding Act was signed. As I said earlier, unfortunately, the United States and other members of the alliance do not appear ready to sincerely consider these three pivotal elements of our initiative. At the same time, they have advanced a number of ideas of their own concerning European security, specifically, intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles, and military transparency, which Russia is open to discussing. We are ready to continue the negotiation track provided that all items are considered in their entirety, in conjunction with Russia’s main proposals, which are an unconditional priority for us. President Lukashenko and I touched on the intra-Ukrainian conflict as well. The settlement process remains stalled; despite all our efforts, neither the contacts at the level of advisers to the leaders of the Normandy Format countries nor the consultations with our partners are helping. Kiev is not complying with the Minsk Agreements and, in particular, is strongly opposed to a direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk. Kiev is essentially sabotaging the agreements on amending the Constitution, on the special status of Donbass, on local elections and on amnesty – on all the key items in the Minsk Agreements. Besides, basically, human rights are massively and systematically violated in Ukraine, and discrimination against the Russian-speaking population is being fixed at the legislative level. The President of Belarus and I agreed that the Minsk Agreements are the key to restoring civil peace in Ukraine and relieving tension around that country. All Kiev needs to do is sit down at the negotiating table with representatives of Donbass and agree on political, military, economic and humanitarian measures to end the conflict. The sooner this happens, the better. Unfortunately, right now, we are witnessing the opposite – the situation in Donbass is worsening. In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Lukashenko for our productive cooperation. I am confident that today’s talks will serve to further strengthen the entire scope of allied relations between Russia and Belarus. Tomorrow, as we agreed, we will take part in several regular events related to our joint military activities. Go ahead please, Mr President. Let me go first, if you do not mind. I just did not pay attention to it. There is a lot of fake news, and constantly reacting to it is not worth it.  We are doing what we feel we need to do, and we will keep going this way. Of course, we are watching the developments in the world and around us; however, we have clear and understandable benchmarks corresponding to the national interests of the Russian people and the Russian state.  We must help ourselves in this respect, and this is the goal of our current meeting. We primarily focused, as Mr Lukashenko has already said, on economic issues, on issues of economic cooperation. The President of Belarus was very eloquent. He said the world is big, and one cannot put a lock on everything. This is exactly what it is in reality, and I join this assessment. We talked about the entire range of problems, including the one you mentioned. I will not go into detail now, but there is always a solution. As for what direction we should move in overall – I have already talked about this and would like to emphasise it again. First, this sanctions pressure is absolutely illegitimate. This is a gross violation of international law. Those who talk about this law care about it only when they stand to benefit. When there is nothing to gain, they conveniently forget all norms of international public law. We understand this perfectly well. Unfortunately, we have lived in this paradigm for many, many years because the powers that be believe they run the show and always interpret everything in their own favour, ignoring the interests of others. The only way out is to grow stronger from within, primarily in the economy. You are talking about sanctions. They will be imposed in any event. Whether there is some excuse today, for instance, linked with the events in Ukraine, or there is no excuse – one will be found because the goal is different. The goal is to impede the development, in this case, of Russia and Belarus. Those who pursue this objective will always come up with an excuse to introduce various restrictions. I will repeat that these restrictions are illegitimate. They amount to unfair competition. In fact, this is the whole point. In the past eight years, Russia has done much in this area, and this is called import substitution. We have not done everything we planned, but we have accomplished more than 90 percent of the tasks we set for ourselves. We still have to do more, and this is called enhancing economic sovereignty.  Many countries of the world, even US allies, are facing today’s restrictions. But they simply shut their mouth and bear it. As I said many, many years ago, nobody likes this. Nobody likes secondary sanctions or direct sanctions pressure. This boil will certainly burst eventually.  It is important for us today to enhance our economic sovereignty and be more competent and up to date. We must give new impetuses to the modern areas of economic progress: digitalisation, artificial intelligence and genetics, to name a few. This is a complicated and big job – it is impossible to resolve this issue overnight, but we must move in this direction. The integration processes we are dealing with are aimed at precisely this goal – to become more competitive. Proceeding from this, we will be striving to improve the living standards of our people.  I think this is all that may be said in the format of a news conference. ";2022;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;2141;YES;multiple
340;Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress that while we focused, of course, on the terrorist threat, we went far beyond that particular problem and discussed the whole range of issues pertaining to relations between Russia and NATO. It was a very frank and substantive discussion. We discussed the situation in various regions of the world and ways to improve the relations between Russia and NATO. We have accumulated a good experience of cooperation. And I think we could profitably discuss the development of our relations in at least two areas. These are joint efforts in the purely political sphere and broadening our cooperation in the fight against terror. The Secretary General did not mention it, but I don’t think I would divulge a big secret if I say that the Secretary General has proposed creating a working body to consider the possibilities of expanding, deepening and qualitatively improving the relations between Russia and NATO. I find it a very good and useful proposal. We will certainly support it. Thank you for the initiative.  Thank you.  I think that within such an Alliance as NATO and those within the context of Article 5, such a request is quite appropriate and quite a normal practice. And quite naturally this list was sent, distributed amongst the NATO members and was not sent to Russia because Russia is not a NATO member. But we are familiar with the contents of the list of the issues and problems. There was no secret about this list for Russia. The exchange of information in the area that you mentioned is underway as we speak between Russia and the United States on a bilateral basis. At the political level we are extremely satisfied with the way things develop while at the operational level the mechanisms that exist would require further improvement and refinement. Let me begin with the second part of your question. I have just been answering a similar question put to me by a correspondent of Le Monde at the first news conference today following our meeting with the European Union leadership. Our position on NATO expansion is known and it has not changed in any way. Of course we said so to the Secretary General today. In the light of the recent events I think what I am going to say should be clear and evident. Let us imagine that NATO expands. New members are admitted to the organisation. Who will feel more secure as a result? Which European country will be more secure? The people of which country will feel more secure? Ask any person in the street in Berlin or Paris or any other capital whether the NATO decision makes him or her feel more secure against terrorist threats of a scale and character that occurred in New York and Washington. The answer, I am sure, will be “no”.  I think we should break the pattern when the problem of expansion keeps rekindling a kind of destructive discussion between Russia and NATO. We should break away from that logic. And this brings me to the answer to the first part of your question. Have the Western leaders heard our signals about our readiness to see closer cooperation between Russia and NATO? We have a feeling that these signals have been heard. It remains to be seen what the practical outcome will be. But I know the clearly expressed position of the President of the United States, and we feel a change in the approach of the Western community and the United States after the clear signals from the US President on the need to change the character of relations between Russia and the United States and the whole Western community. We are aware of practical changes taking place in the quality of our relations. And I can say pretty much the same after meeting with the leadership of the European Union. The practical proposal made by the NATO Secretary General today confirms that NATO too is ready to expand and change the quality of relations with the Russian Federation. We are ready to work towards that end. ;2001;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;740;YES;multiple
241;"To me the Chancellor is the only Western leader, or for that matter — Eastern leader, with whom I can speak the same language in the direct and figurative meaning of the word. That does make communication and our joint work easier. It contributes to a better understanding in human terms. But I don’t think this is the most important thing. The most important thing — and I am not saying it with undue pathos – is the awareness of how important Russian-German relations are for our peoples, for the whole of Europe and for the world. This is what encourages us to make sure that at the personal level our relations enable us to tackle the complicated tasks that we face.  I am very pleased with the way our relationship with the Chancellor is shaping up. We are on first-name terms with him. That simplifies things. It enables us to discuss with absolute frankness areas which one cannot always discuss with leaders at such a high level.  Wait a bit. We’ll come to Europe in a moment. After the collapse of the huge communist empire, Russia finds itself in a fairly difficult situation. The ruins of that empire are holding Russia back.  Of course we accept common European values. We seek to make them our own. But it has become fashionable in recent years to “snipe” at Russia with and without any reason and to take jabs at it without bothering to look deeper into the processes taking place in our country. Russia has still not lived down a certain guilt complex with regard to others. It alternately looks at its partners, sad-eyed, or moos something incoherently like a cow suffering from mad cow disease or other diseases that are widespread in Europe today.  But in reality the processes taking place in our country are not all that different from what we observe in other countries, in Europe or in Northern America.  We have mentioned Europe. In 1986 General Electric bought NBC. They too went through complicated procedures connected with property and had problems with their staff. And what was happening to employees when Mr. Murdoch was buying up the press in Great Britain?  In Germany today Bild, I think, is negotiating with some companies which have close links with the Government. If we speak about property rights, they should be held sacred everywhere. At the turn of the 1990s, many work collectives here introduced the rule whereby they elected their directors. But this has nothing to do with the bedrock principles of the market economy in which the owner names the head of the company.  As for freedom of expression, freedom of the press and so on, they must of course be ensured. But they can only be ensured on one condition: if the economic conditions are acceptable for the free press. The playing field should be level. This is the aim of the state and my aim as the head of state.  What do we have in the case of NTV? The Prosecutor General’s Office claims that one of the shareholders has fraudulently acquired 1.5 billion US dollars. Some employees have recently received 6.6 million US dollars over and above their official salaries under “grey” schemes of dubious legality. That figure has not been challenged. But nobody has repaid the credits.  Some staff members are presenting demands to the present manager and some senior journalists have already left the company. The Moscow Government announced today that it has financial claims to the company.  I don’t think that under the circumstances I have the right to interfere in a dispute between business entities. Having said that, I agree with you that the Government should do all it can to guarantee the freedom of every citizen to express his or her will, and the freedom of the press. You know, Europe can’t do that because there is no one to do the fighting in Europe. But the dilemma facing the Europeans is basically the same as that which faced Russia. Either to block the destructive forces within Kosovo and to prevent them from attacking their neighbours and destabilising Central Europe, or to fight them on their own territory. In fact, by adopting UN Security Council Resolution 1244 the international community declared that it was ready to take the second option and disarm the Albanian terrorists. Unfortunately, this has not been done. And now we hear that it is already too late. This is what I had in mind when I said that nationalism and religious extremism cannot be used to achieve political goals. You have armed them and now nobody knows what to do about them. I think Europe has only one option: to create a strong border and proceed in accordance with the UN Security Council resolution, to continue attempts to disarm the terrorists, to respect the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and put part of the responsibility for the province on the Yugoslavian authorities. Otherwise Europe would be directly responsible. Is that what Europe wants?  And of course, the danger is very serious, because Europe in fact is getting its own little Afghanistan or Chechnya, and not in its backyard but in its very heart. You know, the danger lies not only in the spread of narcotics, although already 60–70% of narcotics come to Western Europe via Kosovo. It is not only about criminal business or arms trafficking or prostitution. In my opinion – and this is the first time I am saying it in public – the main danger [of the Balkan crisis] for Europe is that given transparent borders (and it is practically impossible to protect the borders because of the mountainous terrain) that territory, which no one controls, may provide a bridgehead for a criminal onslaught on Europe’s economy. Small and medium-sized European businesses may become the earliest victims.  What is the European accustomed to? Where does he go if he faces lawlessness? To the law court. And the terrorists have only one response: a bullet in the head. And then they hide in a territory which no one controls. This is a situation Europe will have a hard time sorting out. I don’t think it is ready for it.  So, what needs to be done today is what the Federal Chancellor said. It is necessary to unite our efforts to prevent the spread of negative trends in the region. I absolutely agree with him.  Yes, indeed, I did not directly refer to our relations with the United States, but it does not mean that we underestimate the role of the United States in the world or don’t want to cooperate with it. That is not the case. And I would not like it to be interpreted in this way. Of course we are in Europe, we are part of Europe territorially, geographically, historically and culturally. But we are aware of the role the United States plays in the world today. It is one of our leading partners. You may have noticed that my Address referred to NATO and the fact that we want to promote our relations with that organisation. Whatever NATO procedures are, the leading NATO partner is the United States. And we recognize that.  Our Foreign Minister is due to meet the Secretary of State the day after tomorrow. We hope it will mark an important step in the development of our relations with the United States. We very much hope that the results of the recent exchanges between the two countries will be revised, and even though a different administration was in power, that all positive trends that have been accumulated between Russia and the United States in the past years will be preserved. And there was much that was positive.  As regards the United States attitude to Russia, there are some very good, positive signals. In spite of the row over diplomats, the mutual expulsion of diplomats, we took note of what President Bush said, and he said that he did not see Russia as an enemy. I think it is an important signal. We have heard it and we look forward, I repeat, to positive shifts.  As for how the United States sees Russia’s role, that of course is up to the United States. We cannot dictate or impose our will. But we see the same attitude not only to Russia, but to some other countries or global problems. Take for instance, the attitude to the Kyoto accords.  But I don’t think we should over dramatize things. The Administration has not yet been formed. Only the key figures have been appointed. And as you know, it is the retinue that plays the king. The retinue has not yet been formed. Overall, we think that positive elements have prevailed in our relations in recent years. It prompts optimism with regard to our bilateral relations.  Let me be the first, to give my colleague a rest. I think it is above all a Russian problem, and we have to admit that. The problem is the deficiency of our legislation in a number of areas. These obviously include tax legislation; customs legislation; guarantees of property rights; effective functioning of the legal system, the court system. And that is only the beginning of the list. It includes currency legislation, the free movement of capital, liberalisation of the banking sphere. Russia has to do a great deal to meet Western standards. That is why, I think, integration and penetration into the Russian economy meet with such difficulties. But it has to be noted that much has been done recently, as you know. It has been achieved exclusively due to the political consolidation of Russian society. It was hard to imagine that a year ago the country’s parliament would have voted for some of the laws it has passed.  That, and not so much our economic progress during the past year, should give cause for optimism to us and to our partners.  Germany is part of the Schengen zone. And that of course attracts our attention in connection with the enlargement of Europe. I must say that we do not object to it and we do nothing to oppose it. In fact, as I have said, we welcome the enlargement of Europe, but we draw our partner’s attention to the fact that already 35% of our trade is with the European Community. And after the admission of new members it will be 50%. Of course business activities and social and cultural contacts are connected with visas. And we hope that our partners will meet us halfway and that this regime will match the level of our political relations. ";2001;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;1994;YES;multiple
3562;"Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to have this chance to meet with Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg here in Murmansk, a city that without question holds a special place in the context of Russian-Norwegian cooperation. This city is the centre for numerous different ties between our countries and focus of our common history. Today, we witnessed the signing of a historic document – a decision that will, I hope, determine the substance of our relations for decades to come. And it is for this reason that we signed this Treaty on Maritime Delimitation and Cooperation in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean here. As I said to the Prime Minister just now, it took us 40 years to reach this treaty. This is a long time, but this event will without question open a new chapter in our bilateral relations. Furthermore, as we said at the talks just before, this event will have an impact on the overall situation in the region, helping to strengthen international and regional security and improve cooperation between the Arctic countries. But in describing this treaty, if I could state the most important aspect in a few words, it is that by settling this issue that has remained open for several decades, we can now build our relations in more constructive fashion, in a more predictable environment, and find solutions to all manner of joint tasks, including implementation of joint economic projects. Perhaps most important of all is that clearly delimiting the borders in a region where our interests meet is most certainly a very big step forward.  I expect this treaty will also strengthen our cooperation opportunities in the energy sector and our cooperation in fishing and the other sectors of our mutual involvement. Today, we discussed a number of projects in which we have established good relations. This includes energy projects, and I hope very much that these projects will progress in the friendly, strategic spirit that we spoke about during my state visit to Norway. I would like to see our relations develop too in the transport sector, cooperating in developing transport corridors, including the Northern Sea Route. The Prime Minister just said, in fact, that our two countries have started shipping via this route right now, thus opening a new stage in our cooperation. We discussed a wide range of issues, including cooperation in the environment and on nuclear and radiation security. These are our common concerns and we are ready to continue working together in these areas. There are issues of our marine environment, which is our common development base and our common concern, and so we are ready to cooperate here. Of course, we have good prospects for building up our humanitarian ties. I believe that the diverse contacts between our countries and the potential we have today will continue to develop. As I said to the Prime Minister, aside from this very important and significant treaty that it took us 40 years to reach, on our agenda today were also a number of less significant — depending on what you compare them with – but nonetheless essential agreements. I hope that all of these documents will be ready soon for our joint examination and discussion. I also thanked the Prime Minister for Norway’s participation in a project that really has great moral significance for us. This was the construction of a sports-oriented boarding school in Beslan. The school opened its doors at the start of September. This is a wonderful present, of course, and a vivid example of the friendship between our countries. Once more, I want to thank the Norwegian government for taking part in projects such as this. Mr Prime Minister, you have the floor. Prime Minister of Norway Jens Stoltenberg (retranslated): President Medvedev, I would like to congratulate you on this historic day for Russia, for Norway, and for our bilateral relations. We are now opening a new era in cooperation between our nations. This is a very important treaty for both countries. I also highly value the fact that we have signed the treaty here, in Murmansk, because Murmansk is the most important city for our relations. We already have good cooperation here, which has been and is developing. The fact that today we resolved here the last major unsettled issue between our states witnesses that we are promoting and will further promote cooperation to mutual advantage of both Norway and Russia. At our talks we certainly respected the interests of both nations, and we found a solution well balanced in every legal aspect. We now have a very good, explicit, predictable treaty for controlling and exploiting the resources of the maritime space. The treaty is very powerful for various reasons. First of all, the treaty per se is important because it is critical for the two sides to have determinate and straightforward borders which are 1,700 kilometres long. This is one of the longest borders in Europe and in the whole world. Now, once the clear border exists, the situations here in the North will be predictable, which is very essential. The second reason why the treaty is significant is that we now have the opportunity to explore and exploit the natural resources located here in the North. We will continue cooperating in fisheries in such a way as to ensure a stable situation, so that the fish resources remain stable in the future. At some stage, we can also jointly develop our oil and gas resources here in the North. I would like to say to the negotiators that they did not merely draft the treaty on delimitation; we will cooperate in the fisheries and in exploiting oil, gas, and resources located on our side and your side – the cross-border resources. So now we have a treaty on the border and on cooperation in fishing, oil, and gas sectors. The third reason why the treaty is important is that it applies all the principles of international law. Thus, we now know that similar disputes can be resolved between other nations, in other parts of the world. The treaty can inspire those who want to find solutions in other areas of the planet. In other words, the treaty is important in and of itself, and because we can now use our natural resources and also because we adhere to the principles of international law, which is very essential. We believe this approach may be employed in other parts of the North as well. We are already working closely together, and the fact that we are meeting here is another proof to this. We already have 20 Norwegian companies actively operating here in Murmansk and the Murmansk Region in many industries; some are also active suppliers in the oil and gas industries. They can now see new opportunities. We must continue fostering cooperation. Our foreign minister will open a Norwegian Consulate tomorrow in Arkhangelsk which shows that we are developing our cooperation here in the North. We hope that in the coming months, in fall of this year, we will be able to sign an agreement on special provisions for people living by the border to be able to cross the border without any problems. The treaty that was signed here must now be ratified and we hope that the ratification will take place in the near future. We on the Norwegian side intend to do everything to ensure that the treaty is ratified by our parliament before the end of the year. I am very happy that we have been able to sign the treaty so quickly, given that we only came to a consensus on it in April. But this treaty is not the end of our work, rather the beginning of new cooperation between Norway and Russia. It opens a new era in the relations between our two nations, and it is a very important treaty for Russia, for Norway, and for cooperation between our countries. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate your congratulations. I will begin by specifically noting that I know Mr Medvedev you referred to very well. He is not a relative of mine, but he and I are well-acquainted through our work in Gazprom. He is a professional, although he does not only promote gas cooperation, but national ice hockey as well [as President of Kontinental Hockey League], and seems to be good at both. I nevertheless believe he has a good knowledge of gas industry. As far as Norwegian technologies in Yamal peninsula are concerned, we would indeed like for our Norwegian friends to use their best ideas and know-how for modernising, specifically, Russia’s gas and petrochemical facilities. We are already negotiating Yamal operations, so I certainly hope that this cooperation has good prospects. Thank you. Let me start answering this question. Clearly, the purpose of the treaty is the delimitation of our interests. In absence of such a treaty, there is always cause for mutual suspicions and reproaches, for some third countries to try to turn an unsettled problem to their advantage. So in this sense, this is a truly important, historic treaty. Within a relatively short period of time, perhaps even the shortest possible, Mr Prime Minister and I accomplished the process, which has lasted for decades, having offered the constructive positions of both sides and the reasonable compromises that are prerequisites for these kinds of talks. Nevertheless, in my view, the treaty we have is perfectly crafted in terms of legal instrumentation. It is well-adjusted and reflects a balance of interests in all sensitive areas of cooperation. This is, first and foremost, energy, because the unresolved issue of territorial demarcation and maritime delimitation was an obstacle for launching major energy projects, and we were not satisfied with that – we would like these kinds of projects to develop at a higher level of intensity. Among the issues that always come up are issues regarding how we can exploit the mineral deposits that are located in areas under the jurisdiction of both sides – in other words, shared mineral deposits. In my view, there can only be one effective answer to this matter, it is that such mineral deposits must be exploited jointly. Mr Prime Minister cited the example of the absolutely successful cooperation between Norway and the United Kingdom in a similar project. I think this is the best approach as it brings together efforts, money, and technologies, and I suppose that’s what’s most valuable. As for questions concerning the fisheries, this is an important and sensitive issue, because a large number of our compatriots are employed in this sector. In this regard, the treaty does not implement anything new that could change the fishing regulations or revise the respective existing agreements in this domain. But I hope that it will create a new environment wherein we can agree on certain disputed situations that have always occurred and will probably continue to occur. In other words, this is probably a kind of push toward a more constructive and partner-like cooperation. During our talks, I told Mr Prime Minister openly that we expect it will become a symbol of closer, more partner-like relations in the fisheries. We will certainly continue consultations on this very issue. The heads of the corresponding agencies in charge of the issue will receive appropriate instructions from Mr Prime Minister and myself. As for major projects in the future, there will indeed be projects of this kind, and there are already specific deadlines. Right now, I think what’s most essential is not to postpone them, but to progress at a pace already gained, and naturally, to seek resolutions on issues where there are still disagreements. Mr Prime Minister and I have discussed this matter, but treaties are not signed to bury them in some dusty box and then mess about. Naturally, we sign these documents to ratify them. What is important is that all procedures prescribed by law are respected. Our Parliament has its own procedures, just as the Storting has its own rules. In addition, I think there is a general atmosphere around the ratification that may either help it, or hinder it. But we are hoping that as a result of joint efforts the atmosphere around the treaty will help ratify it because it is really a complex agreement and one that took us a long time to reach. Therefore, I assume that our Norwegian partners and we will try to synchronise these processes. This question is not for me? Good. Then it would be better if Mr Prime Minister begins. Russia is not part of NATO, so that our voice comes second in any case. That’s right, the Arctic belongs to us, to all of us together. In my opinion, we could do without NATO in the Arctic because it is part of our common heritage, which, strictly speaking, does not have anything to do with military objectives. We are fully capable of managing there with the use of economic regulation and international agreements we sign. At the same time, of course, NATO has its own policy, which is determined by the alliance itself. In any case, the Russian Federation watches such activity intently and with some concern. Why? Because after all it is an area of peaceful cooperation, economic cooperation, and the presence of a military factor at the very least raises additional issues. If we talk about the prospects of cooperation, then certainly to my mind they are not linked in any way with an increased presence of the North Atlantic Alliance in the Arctic region. I think that we can use an entirely different foundation for our collaboration. But once again, I would like to emphasise that NATO decides this issue for itself. We would like to see the zone of Arctic cooperation as peaceful and calm, a zone where we can negotiate in the way we have just negotiated with our Norwegian friends. And I, in turn, would like to thank all participants in the negotiations for their political courage and the resolute decisions that have been taken, which, ultimately, reflect a balance of interests of the parties. I am confident that they will contribute to further development of the strategic partnership between our nations. Overall, this year has been very busy and productive with first my state visit to Norway and now this working visit that has seen us sign this historic treaty, and this shows that our relations are developing very well and have a good future ahead.";2010;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;2700;YES;multiple
3120;"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly happy to welcome the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Klaus, to our nation. The last time we met [on May 22, 2009], it was in Khabarovsk on the sidelines of the Russia-EU summit, which was quite successful, I think, due to the Czech Republic’s chairmanship. It is true, we had resolved many of our problems by the summit time, but some traces of last year’s complications still remained. Nevertheless, thanks to the Czech chairmanship, we were able to advance to the current level of highly dynamic relations. I mention it because it was our first meeting, and it laid a good foundation for continuing the dialogue here in Moscow.  As I said to Mr President, our talks here today have been somewhat unperplexed as we are not affected by jet lag and time zone differences, the weather is nice and our overall communication is enjoyable. Today, we discussed all the fundamental issues in Russian-Czech relations. We talked about the economy and about the bilateral projects that bind our nations, as well as the global economy and how quickly it is likely to recover from the recession; we also discussed today’s economic problems in Russia and the Czech Republic.  I think the talks were very useful, because our economies are linked to one another. In recent years, we have seen very high trade turnover, although more recently, it has declined because of the crisis. This decline is significant, but I think that in any case, we have every opportunity to make it grow again, especially because even today, it can be measured in billions of euros. I am also certain that in the future, our trade turnover will remain at a high level, which will be good for our nations. We have many investment projects, and we discussed some of them. We spoke about projects in energy, including projects involving the supply of various types of energy resources to the Czech Republic. We talked about the fact that Russia is indeed providing energy products to many European nations. At the same time, Russia does not act as an exclusive energy source. In any event, it is in our interests to make sure Europe is getting gas, oil, electricity or whatever other energy resources from several countries. But in this respect, I believe it is very important to have a common framework for overall energy relations. We reviewed the relevant idea proposed by Russia and explored the need to improve the Energy Charter. We hold similar positions on these issues. As Mr President said, the document that exists today must reflect the interests of suppliers, purchasers, and transit nations. In my view, this is quite important, and we must work on this jointly with all European nations, including the Czech Republic. We spoke about issues of strategic security. I talked about the [UN] General Assembly that recently took place in New York. In my view, it was the best General Assembly of the past decades, because the mood there has changed. Many global players are now taking a more open position. The nations that took a harder stance before are now beginning to recognise the multipolar nature of the world. All of this improves our opportunities for cooperation and may allow us to resolve some of the most difficult problems standing before us today, such as the Middle East peace process, issues of Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programmes, and several other topics that we are consulting on with our European colleagues, the United States of America, and other countries. We also spoke about cultural projects. Mr President had an idea, and if Mr President does not mind, I would like to make it public now. We are thinking about exhibiting some of the treasures from the Moscow Kremlin [museums] in Prague. We will consider how to organise this event, as well as its timeframe. It would be preferable to accomplish the idea without any delay, as I think this would be a great investment in the development of our humanitarian cooperation, and Mr President should be credited for this idea. For my part, I will help do whatever I can to make it work. We have many common interests and we discussed many interesting joint projects. As a result, I feel that Mr President’s visit has been very timely and successful, especially since it has not yet ended – Mr President will speak before [Moscow State University] students who are currently waiting to hear what the President of the Czech Republic has to say, following the speech made by the U.S. Secretary of State, to see whether there are differences in their positions or whether their stances are similar. Overall, I think it is very important — especially since the President’s schedule includes a business component – that there will be a meeting with Russian and Czech business people. This is very good, because we have many joint projects. Today alone, as far as I understand, a large number of agreements will be signed – agreements worth hundreds of millions of euro. This demonstrates that in spite of the crisis – not our national crisis, but the global crisis – our relations are developing and progressing really well. I would like to sincerely thank the President of the Czech Republic for his visit to the Russian Federation, and I hope that we will be able to continue our communication in other places. I can tell you directly that I will be happy to visit. Thank you very much for your invitation. We are ready to take some questions. Life in general is pretty boring without conspiracy theories, without various plots and the machinations of intelligence agencies. So despite the fact that I have not read what the Czech media have written on this subject … I do read it, Mr President. But I have not seen anything on this subject, though of course we follow very closely news from the Czech Republic. But on this subject I have not read anything. I know that media outlets have written a lot about the Lisbon Treaty. I know that they discuss the threat to energy security, with which Russia allegedly menaces the Czech Republic and other EU countries, and the inevitable Russian dominance in this area. But this business about increased activity by our intelligence services escaped my notice. I can only say that there exist very good, friendly relations between our countries. There is no problem on the Russian side. Russian media are not writing about how the secret services of the Czech Republic have intensified their work in Russia. There is no such threat in Russia. I think that what is currently being discussed in the pages of the Czech media is the fruit of the conspiratorial views that have their origins in the period of the Cold War and our previous existence. We need to move on from them. Our initiative remains on the table. My position hasn’t changed either. Of course I have to agree with my Czech counterpart that after certain steps were taken, including those by the administration of the United States of America, some of the problems, at least the European problems, went away. Including the problems which put us in a difficult situation, especially regarding the third launch area. By the way, yesterday when we discussed this issue with Secretary of State of the U.S., we agreed that we must work together to create more extensive, more global means of defence that do not threaten other countries, but at the same time establish full-fledged defence. And speaking of European security, there we maintain the same old, very straightforward position. It lies in the fact that when all is said and done not all questions of European security can be resolved within the existing institutions, whatever institutions we have, the European Union, NATO, OSCE, CIS, or for the post-Soviet states the Collective Security Treaty Organisation.  In my opinion, we still do not have the right platform where we can address these issues. And even despite some easing of tension, despite the resolution of a number of issues, despite the recognition of the multipolar nature of the modern world by significant international players, still the creation of such a platform seems valuable to me. And so we’ll just keep pushing our idea, hoping that our European colleagues will approach it with sympathetic understanding. This does not mean that it can be implemented today or tomorrow. But the fact that we need such a platform is pretty clear, even if one admits that there can be no global government which would be capable of resolving every question. But we do need a place where we can discuss global issues.  At the G20, the summit of the world’s biggest, most important economies held in Pittsburgh, we discussed how the world economy should look, precisely because it’s there that you encounter the major economic players. But Europe also needs such a platform, especially since we are all European countries and all interested in making our common home both modern and secure, and in dealing in the most efficient way with the issues that arise in our lives. We will pursue this idea further. Thank you.";2009;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;1746;YES;single (mentined across other institutions)
285;At May’s Russia-EU meeting in Moscow, on Mr Prodi’s initiative, we instructed our experts to start establishing a common economic space in Europe. But we do not expect this to be a free gift for Russia. If we achieve this objective, this will impose certain obligations on Russia, and will tie our hands in deciding some questions in, say, power generation. But, on the other hand, it will give us certain advantages in other branches. This is the kind of work that must achieve the optimum balance of interests between Russia and the other part of Europe. I am sure that if we reach this objective, then there will be gains all round. We look forward to such an understanding and support on the part of our Austrian partners.  <…> As regards different interpretations of our dialogue with President Bush, I do not think there was anything unusual about it, although Mr Bush and I discussed the matter in the most general way. It was, I repeat, a very frank and a very well meaning conversation, which persuaded not only me, but also my colleagues that the most complex issues can be discussed with the US President. Although our approaches differ, I repeat, we were pleased with the American mood for dialogue.  If you are interested in my meeting with the American press, where I discussed the theme you just mentioned, I can give some additional tips. Over the past few decades peace has been maintained in the world and has never once (with the exception of the Caribbean crisis) been pushed to the edge of a global disaster solely because, I repeat, a certain balance has been reached in the most sensitive area, that of nuclear security. A balance of forces and interests.  We claim that the scrapping of the 1972 ABM Treaty and establishment of a national missile defence system covering the territory of one country, the U.S. in this case, is bound to upset this balance. Any nuclear country, including Russia (especially because, as everyone knows, NATO does not invite us to join it), should think of a way to respond. How to react and how to restore the balance which will no doubt be upset because with the establishment of an NMD the qualitative state of nuclear forces – American forces in this case – will be improved. The improvement will be achieved because they will become invulnerable.  I repeat, this is not our choice. And if this happens, the question is, what shall we do? We, for one, will proceed from one well-known principle, which can be summed up as follows: efficiency plus minimum costs.  What could it be?  To begin with, I want to draw your attention to legal aspects of the matter. A large number of international security agreements, in fact more than 30 of them, are linked with the 1972 ABM Treaty. Among them are START I and START II. Incidentally, America still has not ratified START II, unlike Russia, which has.  If the 1972 ABM Treaty ceases to exist, and with it go START I and START II, then all countries, including Russia, will have the legal right to mount a multiple warhead – 3, 4, 5 and more warheads – and not one nuclear warhead, on every one of their ground-based missiles. That is the most inexpensive reply, which no one can oppose in the next 50 or perhaps 100 years.  They say the NMD is not targeted against Russia. I, too, can say that Russia’s reply, if it takes place, need not worry any one, because it will not be directed against even those who are developing the NMD.  That is, properly speaking, all that can be said. The solution lies on the surface and is perfectly understandable to specialists concerned, both legal experts and military technical personnel. And of course the world public must be informed of that. This is very important.  There can be many replies. I mentioned just one. The purpose of a missile defence system is to protect one’s territory against nuclear ballistic missiles. But there are other ways of delivering the weapons of mass destruction to the territory of a potential opponent. And specialists know them well. Our proposal is that all these questions, all these problems and all possible threats, today and in the future, should be discussed jointly, without upsetting the balance existing in the world.  It is our deeply held belief that all powers, and above all the nuclear powers, and not only they, but also our European partners, have the right to be heard. And they must be listened to during these debates, these negotiations.;2001;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;899;YES;single (mentioned briefly)
5187;Colleagues, We will discuss routine matters today, but we will also examine the biggest current issues too of course. Let’s start with the situation regarding Ukraine and Crimea. Mr Lavrov, what do you have to say on these matters? What can you tell us? How many individuals are affected? We ought to keep our distance from them or they might compromise us. (Laughter) As for the financial institution concerned, as far as I recall, this is a medium-sized bank. Personally, I did not have an account there, but I will definitely open one on Monday. What other information do you have on this matter? In both the first case, the US sanctions, and the second case, the Ukrainian proposal to introduce visas, I think that we should refrain from taking any countermeasures for now, especially as concerns visas for Ukraine, because if we introduce visas for Ukrainian citizens, millions of innocent Ukrainians would suffer, people who are not well off as it is and come to Russia to work and earn a bit of money here to support their families. We should not take such a step. We should continue this cooperation even if our partners from NATO freeze our joint activities. I think that we all have an interest in seeing this project continue. We need to strengthen Afghanistan’s government, and so I ask you not to halt any of this work and I ask the Government to go ahead with the required financing, which was provided for in the Russian budget. As you know, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon raised the question yesterday of sending an OSCE   Background information Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)    mission and UN observers to Ukraine’s eastern and southeastern regions, and I ask you to continue cooperation with our partners on this matter too and find a solution. Thank you. I have a question for Mr Shoigu on the situation with Ukrainian military bases in Crimea. Good. Mr Shoigu, I ask you to ensure a friendly and respectful attitude to everyone, no matter what their decision, and respectful treatment too of Ukraine’s state and military emblems. Does anyone have anything else to add? That’s all rather clever sounding, but it does make a substantial point. Yes, it sounds rather weighty, but what we have before us is precisely this kind of case. If this is so, then we should revoke the agreement in accordance with the set procedure. But this raises the matter of the $11 billion that our budget has lost. I think it is perfectly fair to raise the question of having Ukraine’s budget compensate these funds. This could be done through the courts, in accordance with the revoked agreement’s terms. Of course, these are tough measures, but at the same time, the agreement no longer has effect, but the money we paid is real, and our Ukrainian partners must understand that nobody hands over money just like that, for nothing. At the same time, I remind you that Ukraine’s debt, public and corporate, to Russia is quite large as it is. This includes the $3-billion loan that we gave them recently in accordance with our agreement to buy Eurobonds, and the nearly $2 billion that Ukraine owes in accumulated debt to Gazprom. All in all then, Ukraine’s total debt comes to a very large sum.  11 billion plus 5 billion? Yes, it comes to all of $16 billion. I don’t think we can afford to lose that kind of money given that our budget faces difficulties of its own. I propose that we examine these issues in accordance with the set procedures. Mr Medvedev, remind me of the situation please. The way things turned out, we gave Ukraine a discount on energy resources immediately after signing the agreement, that is, starting in 2010, but we acted in advance so to speak, because the use of the naval base was still covered by the old agreement until 2017. In other words, we gave Ukraine this money in advance. Yes, that is the situation, Mr President. This was essentially an advance payment taking into account our particular agreements at that moment. In principle, we could have chosen not to pay this money, but we did so, given that this was part of the new agreement’s terms, and it was also a way of helping Ukraine. But now that the circumstances have changed, this advance payment should be returned. Yes, there are grounds for this. Let’s not take any hasty steps though. Let’s discuss the whole matter and analyse it. I ask the Foreign Ministry to join in this work too and then present proposals together with the Government. <…>;2014;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;909;YES;single
8709;Being Open, Despite the Past On June 22, 1941, exactly 80 years ago, the Nazis, having conquered practically the whole of Europe, attacked the USSR. For the Soviet people the Great Patriotic War – the bloodiest one in the history of our country – began. Tens of millions of people lost their lives, the economic potential of the country and its cultural property were severely damaged. We are proud of the courage and steadfastness of the heroes of the Red Army and home front workers who not only defended the independence and dignity of our homeland, but also saved Europe and the world from enslavement. Despite attempts to rewrite the pages of the past that are being made today, the truth is that Soviet soldiers came to Germany not to take revenge on the Germans, but with a noble and great mission of liberation. We hold sacred the memory of the heroes who fought against Nazism. We remember with gratitude our allies in the anti-Hitler coalition, participants in the Resistance movement, and German anti-fascists who brought our common victory closer.  Having lived through the horrors of the world war, the peoples of Europe were nevertheless able to overcome alienation and restore mutual trust and respect. They set a course for integration in order to draw a final line under the European tragedies of the first half of the last century. And I would like to emphasize that the historical reconciliation of our people with the Germans living both in the east and the west of modern united Germany played a huge role in the formation of such Europe. I would also like to remind that it was German entrepreneurs who became ”pioneers“ of cooperation with our country in the post-war years. In 1970, the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a ”deal of the century“ on long-term natural gas supplies to Europe that laid the foundation for constructive interdependence and initiated many future grand projects, including the construction of the Nord Stream gas pipeline. We hoped that the end of the Cold War would be a common victory for Europe. It seemed that just a little more effort was needed to make Charles de Gaulle's dream of a single continent – not even geographically ”from the Atlantic to the Urals“, but culturally and civilizationally ”from Lisbon to Vladivostok“ – become a reality. It is exactly with this logic in mind – the logic of building a Greater Europe united by common values and interests – that Russia has sought to develop its relations with the Europeans. Both Russia and the EU have done a lot on this path. But a different approach has prevailed. It was based on the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance which was itself a relic of the Cold War. After all, it was specifically created for the confrontation of that era. It was the bloc's movement eastwards – which, by the way, began when the Soviet leadership was actually persuaded to accept the united Germany's accession to NATO – that turned into the main reason for the rapid increase in mutual mistrust in Europe. Verbal promises made in that time such as ”this is not directed against you“ or ”the bloc's borders will not get closer to you“ were quickly forgotten. But a precedent was set. And since 1999, five more “waves” of NATO expansion have followed. Fourteen new countries, including the former Soviet Union republics, joined the organization, effectively dashing hopes for a continent without dividing lines. Interestingly, this was warned about in the mid-1980s by Egon Bahr, one of the SPD leaders, who proposed a radical restructuring of the entire European security system after German unification, involving both the USSR and the United States. But no one in the USSR, the USA or Europe was willing to listen to him at the time. Moreover, many countries were put before the artificial choice of being either with the collective West or with Russia. In fact, it was an ultimatum. The Ukrainian tragedy of 2014 is an example of the consequences that this aggressive policy has led to. Europe actively supported the unconstitutional armed coup in Ukraine. This was where it all started. Why was it necessary to do this? Then incumbent president Yanukovych had already accepted all the demands of the opposition. Why did the USA organize the coup and the European countries weak-heartedly support it, provoking a split within Ukraine and the withdrawal of Crimea? The whole system of European security has now degraded significantly. Tensions are rising and the risks of a new arms race are becoming real. We are missing out on the tremendous opportunities that cooperation offers – all the more important now that we are all facing common challenges, such as the pandemic and its dire social and economic consequences. Why does this happen? And most importantly, what conclusions should we draw together? What lessons of history should we recall? I think, first and foremost, that the entire post-war history of Greater Europe confirms that prosperity and security of our common continent is only possible through the joint efforts of all countries, including Russia. Because Russia is one of the largest countries in Europe. And we are aware of our inseparable cultural and historical connection to Europe. We are open to honest and constructive interaction. This is confirmed by our idea of creating a common space of cooperation and security from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean which would comprise various integration formats, including the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union. I reiterate that Russia is in favour of restoring a comprehensive partnership with Europe. We have many topics of mutual interest. These include security and strategic stability, healthcare and education, digitalization, energy, culture, science and technology, resolution of climate and environmental issues.  The world is a dynamic place, facing new challenges and threats. We simply cannot afford to carry the burden of past misunderstandings, hard feelings, conflicts, and mistakes. It is a burden that will prevent us from concentrating on the challenges at hand. We are convinced that we all should recognize these mistakes and correct them. Our common and indisputable goal is to ensure security on the continent without dividing lines, a common space for equitable cooperation and inclusive development for the prosperity of Europe and the world as a whole.;2021;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;1189;YES;multiple
2872;Ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the media, I will start by saying that it is a great pleasure, of course, to see Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi here in Moscow. This visit is taking place in two stages as it were. But before telling you about what we worked on today, what we discussed, I want to say that of course we talked about the recent earthquake in Italy, and in this respect, I want to say once again that we express our sympathy and condolences to our Italian friends, to everyone in Italy.  We discussed the overall development of our relations today, including with respect to the agreements concluded yesterday, the energy sector agreements. We think these are very important agreements for our country. They are important not just for our country but for the entire European continent, because without strengthening the energy dialogue and reaching agreements on energy supplies, no reasonable development will be possible. What took place yesterday with the participation of our colleague, the Prime Minister [Vladimir Putin] was therefore very good.  We exchanged views on development of our trade and economic relations. Our trade turnover came to more than $50 billion last year. This is a very good result of course. Given the economic crisis, I am not sure that we will manage to maintain this level this year, but we are doing everything possible to keep our trade relations growing actively. A big delegation of Italian businesspeople visited earlier this year, and we had meetings with them. This is the best guarantee that our business contacts will continue, that our economies will develop, that we will preserve jobs and that our trade will grow. We definitely need to continue these kinds of contacts.  It is also important to continue building up our contacts in other areas too, in humanitarian and cultural cooperation. We have taken a number of good steps in this direction this year. I made a brief visit to Italy and took part in the ceremony handing back the pilgrimage complex in Bari. This was a big event for us, of course, and I want to thank once again the Italian Prime Minister for the help that Italy gave Russia on this matter. This is of symbolic importance for our country, and we will never forget this.  We discussed the international situation and spoke about the problems we face today. Of course, top of the agenda was the economic crisis. We reiterated our mutual desire to work together on solutions to the current economic problems, including through bilateral economic cooperation.  One particularly important issue is that of achieving stability and security on the European continent and developing relations along the whole perimeter. This applies to relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union, and to relations between the Russian Federation and NATO. There have been both achievements and problems in these relations. I will not go into detail on them right now. But whatever the case, cooperation in this area is essential. Last year’s experience, when dramatic events unfolded, when our country encountered problems in the Caucasus and war broke out in the South Caucasus, showed that a great deal depended on the position taken by our closest partners. I want to say a special thanks to Mr Berlusconi for the active part he played in resolving this problem. He made great efforts at that time to look for a compromise that would pave the way to a mutually acceptable solution.  European security is therefore a matter of crucial importance. I want to say once more that our proposal on a new European security treaty is aimed precisely at creating a new platform for cooperation in Europe, in which NATO members and non-NATO members could work together and thus set European security on a broader and more solid foundation.  I think that if we want to make progress on security issues, we need to not just come up with new ideas, but also turn to ideas put forward some time ago, and that have already proved their worth. I am referring, for example, to the principles drawn up for relations between Russia and NATO at the Pratica di Mare summit. These were good principles in my view, and I think that we should come back to them in order to further the dialogue between Russia and Italy, and make progress in the dialogue between Russia and the NATO member countries.  We also discussed a number of regional issues of mutual concern to our countries. They included the situation in the Middle East, in Iraq and in Afghanistan. We exchanged views on all of these matters of concern, and we share similar positions on many points.  I am confident that we can achieve new results if we keep moving forward. I think that the Italian Prime Minister’s current visit to our country will give new impetus to developing very close and productive relations between our countries and strengthening our strategic partnership.  Something has changed since the new administration took office in the United States. We have sensed interest in building up relations with Russia, and we have sensed a change in tone. I said already that my first conversation with the President of the United States was very constructive. Probably the most important thing of all was that we showed our willingness and ability to listen to each other’s arguments. There was none of this trying simply to hand out recipes for how to behave in international relations, or, even worse, how to organise our own country’s internal affairs. It was a real and positive dialogue that took place, without any lecturing overtones. This dialogue is now continuing at various levels, and our ministers are in contact with each other, holding meetings with each other. We have drafted two declarations that reflect our common desire to take our relations further, and set out a common framework for how we can achieve this. This covers the preparations for new strategic arms reductions agreements. Work is really going full steam ahead now. We will have a big meeting here in Russia at the start of July, a few days before the summit in Italy. I hope this will take our dialogue to a new level. I hope that both sides will take a realistic approach to the issues on which we currently have differences. Of course, we cannot help but feel concerned about some of the things happening now. In any case, the NATO exercises taking place in Georgia, literally in the very places that were not so long ago the scene of confrontation cannot make us happy. They lead to problems and create tension. We have openly voiced our concerns to our partners, but these exercises are taking place nevertheless. I think that far from contributing to European security they will increase tension, given that Georgia is already in a tense situation as it is. This and a number of other actions that are clearly provocative in nature do not, unfortunately, create the right atmosphere for developing and resuming full-fledged dialogue between the Russian Federation and NATO. But I hope nevertheless, that we will discuss all of these issues at our meeting and perhaps succeed in giving new impetus to our dialogue in these areas. Overall, I think that events are shaping up quite well, and I am looking forward to seeing my colleague in the Russian Federation so as to continue our discussions.  First of all, I want to say that we fully understand the reasons why Italy decided to change the G8 summit’s venue. This is a completely understandable decision in the current circumstances. We will do everything we can to help ensure that the summit is of the highest level in terms of organisation and substance. This is why we are busy preparing now for the discussions between the G8 members themselves, in the broader G8 plus six format, and in the broadest format. Overall, I think we do not have to look far for ideas, unfortunately, because the financial and economic crisis has already set the agenda for us. All top level meetings these days, whether bilateral or multilateral, are devoted to these issues. Naturally, we have proposals of our own to offer. Some of them were put forward at the G20 summit in London, and some of them will be set out at the summit in Italy. Our proposals are similar in essence to those advanced by our partners, including our Italian colleagues. They concern the need to give the world a new and fairer financial and economic set of rules and organisations that takes into account the changes that have taken place in the global economy and international financial system over the last 50–60 years. We need to give the international financial system a new and modern foundation, while at the same time preserving the achievements of past years.  There is no question of simply abolishing the Bretton Woods agreements overnight and replacing them with something new. But we nevertheless need to reflect on how to make the international financial system fairer, give it a set of basic principles that all countries would agree to, modernise the system of corporate supervision, transparency, accounting and reporting on the basis of principles that are not just to the benefit of one group of countries, because the current principles are based on the Anglo-Saxon approach, and this is not to everyone’s liking in Europe, for example.  We need to modernise auditing, accounting and reporting principles, and take steps too to modernise the currency system and make it better protected. The current system, as we know, is based on a number of reserve currencies, chief among which is the United States’ national currency. But we need to think of ways to strengthen this system. We have raised the idea in the past of using other national currencies that could be developed as reserve currencies. We have also spoken about the possibility of making the rouble one of these currencies, and this remains one of our goals.  There are also more global ideas that were not the subject of such broad-format debate at the London summit, but were discussed nonetheless. One of these ideas was that of establishing a supranational currency. We have been looking at reorganising the World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s work, and examining the possibility of using the special drawing rights used within these organisations as a potential supranational currency. Why not go further? These are all matters for the future, but in my view, this future is not far off at all.  Overall, in our efforts to deal with this crisis we need to act not just as countries that have fallen on hard times. We need to come through this crisis as winners and build a new system of international financial and economic relations. This work will continue at the G8 summit in Italy. We hope very much that the summit will be a success, and we will do everything we can to help our Italian friends. Thank you. ;2009;YES;YES;YES;Both - Yes;2044;YES;multiple
8257;Mr President, friends, I would like to warmly welcome you to Moscow. Last year we agreed to hold cross years of Kyrgyzstan in Russia and Russia in Kyrgyzstan. Today, we will have the opportunity to launch these years during which we plan to organise over 200 events. I am sure they will be interesting and will help to develop our ties. These relations are making steady progress practically in all spheres. Russia remains Kyrgyzstan’s key trade and economic partner both in terms of trade and investment.

6870;"Mr Parfenchikov, how long have you been working in the republic? This is a very short time of course, but nevertheless, you are now responsible for the republic. So we will begin with the traditional folder that I hand over to the heads of regions during our meetings, asking them to pay attention to the questions that citizens raised during what is known as my televised Direct Line. The questions are traditional but analysis of what came in to Direct Line shows that unsafe housing is one of the most sensitive issues. I will not enumerate everything here although I feel like using some of the quotes. But bearing in mind that you have been on the job for only five months, there are of course no questions for you. I am simply drawing your attention to these problem areas.  With regard to housing: subsidies for young families. One of the callers is right. Young families are entitled to subsidies until age 35. They have to wait for subsidies for several years and if the situation continues at this rate, they will soon be 35 and will no longer qualify for subsidies.  Another problem is the availability of medical care, especially in small towns. Yes, some changes are taking place in the healthcare system, but these changes must not lead to a situation where small towns, far away from large centres, are left with no medical care at all. Take the town of Kem: “There are no general practitioners or surgeons here, no pediatric, maternity or infections departments; [we] have to travel 250 kilometres. I phoned the Finance Ministry and was told that everything is all right.” This is not all right. Please pay attention to this. Now small towns and single-industry towns – Medvezhyegorsk, Nadvoitsy, Belomorsk and Kondopoga – the problem there is saving jobs. These problems are most likely of a systematic nature and cannot be resolved at one fell swoop. They also require attention. Wage arrears – this is also strange. I believe the Kostomuksha plant is doing okay. Look into what is happening with regard to wages there.  And there is another serious problem – I believe it is highly relevant for Karelia – forest cutting. People are paying attention to this: “The loggers are acting like predators. Logging sites are not cleared for years. The territory’s rich forests and its export potential have absolutely no impact on living standards.” This goes to show that the work in this area is not organised as it should be. The Russian Popular Front has now put environmental problems and logging in particular on its watch list. You can work with them directly. It will not be easy for you to deal with this even with your official status. However, it is one of the problems that needs to be addressed.  I am handing this over to you and hope that you will duly respond to it. Here you are.  Why did this happen? If you need help including these unlisted square metres [into the programme] let me know – I will talk to the Government. Good. <…> ";2017;NO;NO;NO;Random Speech;590;NO;

I think that we have expressed this interest more than once. I hope that we will be able to leave all difficulties behind us and think about the future.;2006;NO;NO;NO;Random Speech;112;NO;
7038;"Good afternoon. Today we will discuss plans for Russia’s electric power industry development and will primarily focus on the objectives of heat generation. It should be noted that the sector’s capacity has improved quite a bit in recent years. Thus, over the last five years, or between 2012 and 2016, heat-generating capacity has increased by 6.7 percent. The industry handles two-thirds of the country’s installed energy capacity or 164 gigawatts. Thermal power stations provide almost 60 percent (57 percent, to be precise) of Russia’s electric power. Along with the increasing capacity, there are also qualitative changes, which is, of course, good to see. Thanks to new facilities, thermal power plants now have a lower accident rate and provide a more reliable power supply to production facilities, social organisations and residential buildings. The use of state-of-the-art technology ensures compliance with higher environmental standards. Such positive dynamics in the work of the Russian energy system, as well as the removal of barriers and the optimisation of administrative procedures, have made it possible to significantly simplify and shorten the timeline for connecting to technological networks. It is a pleasure to note that our country took 10th place in the Getting Electricity category of the World Bank’s updated Doing Business international ranking, so it is among the world leaders. For comparison, back in 2012 we were in 183rd place out of 190 countries. Therefore, the upward movement is clearly significant, which is a positive aspect of your work. Of course, it is necessary to continue developing an infrastructural basis for economic growth and strengthening the social sphere, including increasing the stability and efficiency of thermal power stations. I would emphasise that the created reserve in the form of new capacities gives us today the opportunity to implement a large-scale long-term programme to modernise Russia's thermal power industry. Its priorities are the withdrawal from use and replacement of outdated, inefficient equipment; the introduction of resource-saving, environmentally friendly technologies; and the development of capacities based on modern facilities with higher reliability and efficiency. It is necessary to link these plans with programmes to develop Russia’s territories and key industries and provide reserves for economic growth. And, importantly, investment in renewing generation should cut operating costs, and therefore, I want to emphasise this, the capital costs should not fall on the shoulders of consumers, businesses, citizens, or social and state institutions. In other words, it is necessary to strictly follow the current procedure for establishing energy tariffs. On that note, I will conclude my opening remarks and pass the floor to Mr Novak     Novak AlexanderEnergy Minister , Minister of Energy. Then I will ask Mr Artemyev     Artemyev IgorHead of the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service  to speak, and we will have a discussion. <…>";2017;NO;NO;NO;Random Speech;540;NO;
2856;"Dear veterans! Dear comrades and friends! I am very glad to be meeting with you today. Of course first and foremost I would like to congratulate you on the upcoming great holiday, Victory Day. And I want to wish everyone here long life, health, and of course a cheerful disposition. I think that on this day your moral principles and the powers of endurance that you developed during your service and that have marked your whole lives will help you to stay ‘in the ranks’ and to communicate to the young what you experienced. And I would like to thank you as well for the energy and spiritual dedication with which you carry out this work and to say how important it is for all of us. I think that today we are going to talk about the upcoming Victory Day, about how this Victory was forged, and how it was viewed immediately after the Great Patriotic War. We will be talking about how people occasionally try to reinterpret these events. I believe that we must respond to such things. In any case, in 1945 our nation proved that nobody can impose its will on us and that any act of aggression would be fiercely repelled. I have to say that these were without doubt the most important and the most difficult events of the past century. With us here today there are veterans of the Great Patriotic War, members of other armed conflicts and wars, and representatives of various veterans' organisations. I would also like to hear from you about your current problems and about what you think it would be appropriate to do in anticipation of the 65th anniversary of Victory. For my part I would like to say, or perhaps it would be better to say I would like to assure you, that of course we will continue to deal with veterans' problems – obviously first and foremost social problems – related to transport, drugs and medical services, and we will work on developing high-tech medical assistance. All of this is a normal part of the state's obligations and the state will meet them. There must be no talk of cutting corners here, even in the difficult period in which we find ourselves, even in the crisis, including the economic crisis, that not just our country but the entire world is facing; on such expenses the state will not economise.  By the anniversary of the Victory the state must resolve the series of issues to which I referred, and one of the first executive orders that I signed was about housing for veterans of the Great Patriotic War. I believe that we have everything we need, including material resources, because the designated funds, including an increase required by changes in the plans concerning the size of apartments, were included in the budget. Of course we will meet all these challenges, including the challenge of providing housing, by the date that I have indicated, namely the 65th anniversary of the Victory. We have organised this meeting because this year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Over the years in total 13,000 people had been awarded this title, most of them — 11,695 people — for feats performed in the Great Patriotic War. And in this room today there are heroes who received their awards during the Great Patriotic War. There is another issue to discuss. I recently signed an executive order On the ‘65th Anniversary of Victory in the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War's Jubilee Medal. At the upcoming celebration these medals will be awarded not only to veterans from the Russian Federation but also to those from the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, citizens of other countries that contributed to the Victory, and those who have received awards of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation. I think this is a just way of proceeding, because it was a very difficult page for all of us in our history, in our common history. Dear veterans! Dear colleagues, dear comrades! I will now ask the heads of federal ministries to say a few words. Of course I'll be giving the floor to veterans, to representatives of the Russian Association of Heroes and to leaders of veterans' organisations throughout Russia. And I hope that the ministers will be reporting on what has been done and what will be done in the lead-up to the 65th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.";2009;NO;NO;NO;Random Speech;825;NO;
2506;These are not the easiest times for the stock market. Unfortunately, there are objective reasons for this situation that lie beyond the power of our financial authorities and are not related to economic factors in our own country. Essentially, all of the financial markets and the international financial markets are going through difficult times. At the same time we also have problems of our own. Trends on the stock market have been quite complex of late. But we do not think they are indicative of long-term problems. This is more likely the market’s reaction to a number of unfavourable circumstances, a number of difficulties at the international level and in our own economy. I would like to hear your assessment of the situation and your proposals for a package of measures to stabilise the situation on the Russian stock market. Tomorrow we will hold a meeting on the international financial centre and we will continue this discussion with other colleagues. Please, go ahead.  Director of the Federal Service For Financial Markets Vladimir Milovidov: You are absolutely right: the situation on the Russian financial market today is more a reflection of the complex trends underway in the world at the moment and the crisis processes taking place above all in developed economies such as the United States of America and partly in Europe too. But we are keeping close watch nonetheless on events here in Russia.  Following our market day to day we do indeed see that falls are quite frequent, but at the same time we realise that there are no fundamental causes for this drop. This is confirmed by the fact that today trading on the Russian financial market is growing and transactions are taking place. We also see that deeper changes are taking place on Western markets that could indeed lead to a crisis situation.  Regarding the situation on the Russian market, I think it can be set right and is not dramatic. The Russian market has been a leader in growth over the last 2–2.5 years. What we are seeing today probably reflects a downward correction to this dynamic growth. Set against the almost three-fold increase on our market over the last 2.5–3 years, the drop of around 40 percent we have seen over these last days and months does not look dramatic. In today’s situation, short-term or emergency measures are not so relevant. The Russian market has sufficient internal potential to make emergency measures unnecessary. What we do need right now are long-term measures that will help us to build up the market’s existing potential. This means above all increasing the Russian financial market’s capacity by attracting domestic investors, above all retail investors, and by developing possibilities for our companies to expand on the Russian market and work with new types of financial instruments.  We propose a whole series of measures to address these objectives. In particular, we think it essential to make substantial changes to regulations on issuing securities, remove additional administrative barriers so as to enable not just large companies to use the financial markets to raise capital, but also create the conditions for innovative companies, new companies, to enter the Russian market without having to cross so many administrative hurdles. The law makes this possible in that it provides for the institution of qualified investors, for whom we could expand the range of fairly risky but at the same time attractive instruments and remove additional barriers in the way of issuing such securities on the market.  The same goes for developing the derivatives market. This market represented around 7 trillion roubles at the end of last year, and over the first eight months of this year has now come close to 10 trillion roubles. In other words this market is developing. Of course, this market is not without risks, but we are keeping watch on it. This is a sign that the market players are interested in insuring against risks and monitoring the processes on the financial market, and these instruments are being used to insure against risks.  Regarding other areas, we think the time is right to look at reinforcing and capitalising our infrastructure, our settlements institutions and clearing houses on the financial market, which handle the totality of transactions. Carrying out these measures would help to strengthen our financial market and make it more competitive in the medium term.  You are right. We cannot change the situation on say, the American market. The Americans will have to sort out their mortgage system and other financial instruments themselves, though, to put things plainly, they have let almost all of us down. But there are two issues we clearly need to think about. First, despite the various difficulties, Russian companies’ assets are still undervalued in many cases, and this creates potential for growth.  Second, given that our market is still growing, volatility is an inherent trait and this means that there can be quite serious fluctuations in evaluations, and this has both advantages and disadvantages. I think that, ultimately, the changes you speak about, which are not dramatic, will lead eventually to stabilisation. If the decisions you have listed are taken, the situation will come right and the market will return to practically the same indicators we had at the beginning of the year. In any case, I think this is all within the Government’s power. Tomorrow we will continue this discussion in broader format when we meet to talk about the international financial centre.

4195;Good afternoon, friends, Today’s ceremony is taking place on the eve of the Defender of the Fatherland Day, an occasion widely celebrated throughout our country, in practically every family. I take this opportunity to congratulate sincerely all Armed Forces veterans and all of our soldiers and officers serving today and ready to carry out even the most difficult combat missions. Considering the occasion, let me make special mention among those being decorated today of nuclear cruiser submarine commander Alexei Dmitrov. Under his command his crew has demonstrated on more than one occasion high standards of military professionalism and the best qualities of steadfastness and selflessness. First-rank Captain Dmitrov is receiving the high decoration of Hero of the Russian Federation today.  Gathered here today are people from all walks of life, people who have achieved success in their lives. Your success is not due to luck, chance, and fortunate turns of circumstance (even if these things do play a part in everyone’s life), but is the result above all of your labour, stubborn effort, and desire to put all of your daily effort into your work. I am sure that everything you do provides an excellent example for your friends and colleagues and indeed for many of our citizens. Here today we have people who work in the economy, those who are developing our education, cultural figures, people from a wide range of professions. It would take me a long time to list them all. I propose, therefore, that we move straight on to presenting the state decorations. <…> Once more, I congratulate you all on the Defender of the Fatherland Day. We always need to defend our homeland, and not only during times of war or great trouble. Each of you is defending our country by doing your job, standing up for your views and your values, promoting our culture, and simply defending our forebears’ legacy and achievements.  Lyudmila Chursina quoted a line from Anna Akhmatova about storm clouds over the skies of Russia [“That the storm-cloud which broods over Russia may be changed to a nimbus ablaze”]. Of course, we seldom have a cloudless sky quite simply because of our country’s rather cold climate and enormous size. But this does not mean that we face dramatic problems and immense difficulties at this time.  Certainly, we do have many difficulties. Each of you, every single one of you here today, tries to do what you can to make our life calmer and more comfortable, safer and secure, and quite simply more interesting too, which is something people in the humanities and cultural sphere are doing with success. It is my sincere hope that this year will also be a successful one for Russia, even as the whole world remains in constant movement, global processes boil away, and economic crises continue. But I am confident that we can handle it all, now and in the future. We count above all on professionals in this, on everyone who does not waste words but simply gets on with their jobs. You are these professionals. I thank you sincerely for serving our Fatherland. ;2012;NO;NO;NO;Random Speech;591;NO;
7764;"Good afternoon, colleagues and friends. Allow me to welcome you to Moscow. This is not a foreign city for you. Many of you, probably all of you, have worked in Russia for some time. I would like to thank primarily Mr Dudley for his initiative to meet in this format. I must say that meetings like this with our partners from European and other countries are a permanent practice. We regularly meet with business representatives from France, Germany and Italy, to name a few. As a rule, this helps us plan our cooperation in many diverse areas, helps us understand what concerns our partners, if this is the case, and determines the most promising avenues for cooperation. But we know that regrettably in the past few years and up to this day relations between Britain and Russia have not been at their best. And this is an obstacle for those who are doing positive work. Despite the problems in interstate relations, and it should be admitted that they do exist, thanks to the people who think positively, our trade grew by 23 percent in one go in 2017, strange as it may seem. After energy prices stabilized, it increased by another 8 percent last year to $13.7 billion. Cumulative British investment in the Russian economy amounts today to $23.8 billion while the relevant figure for Russian investment in Britain exceeds $11 billion.  More than 600 enterprises partly owned by British businesses operate in our country. That is quite a large number. They operate in the industry in the broadest sense, such as mechanical engineering, and the pharmaceutical and other innovation-driven industries. The energy corporations of Russia and the UK are involved in producing and processing crude oil and gas, raw materials, and generating and delivering electric power. They are jointly implementing major projects such as Nord Stream 2 and Sakhalin 3. And I am not even talking about BP being the largest shareholder in our leading oil and gas company, Rosneft. Experts from London’s City are involved in efforts to create an international financial centre in Moscow, and the London Stock Exchange facilitates capital flows to Russia. The securities of almost all public Russian companies are listed on the LSE. I would like to emphasise that we in Russia are doing our best to make sure foreign investors, our partners and friends, feel comfortable working on the Russian market and do not come under excessive administrative stress. For your information, Russia is now 31st in the World Bank’s Business Freedom Index having risen dozens of places over the past five years. Positive dynamics continue in all key macroeconomic indicators. According to the latest estimates, the country's GDP added 2.3 percent last year. The growth of industrial output was even higher at 3 percent. Hundreds of billions of dollars will be invested in critical sectors of the economy and the social sphere as part of national projects. I did not misspeak, we are talking about investing hundreds of billions of dollars. I am sure that your companies could be part of this work; the market is large enough for everyone. We hope that once implemented, these projects will have a comprehensive synergetic effect on the dynamic growth of the entire country, and will open up significant business opportunities, including for the British business community. I would like to take this opportunity to encourage British entrepreneurs, who have always been widely represented at the St Petersburg Economic Forum, to take an active part in its work this year. It will take place on June 6–8. This ends my opening remarks and I ask Mr Dudley to speak to us, please.";2019;NO;NO;NO;Random Speech;687;NO;
3384;Dear veterans, Dear citizens of Russia, Dear foreign guests, Comrade soldiers, sailors and sergeants, Comrade officers, generals and admirals, I congratulate you on the jubilee of the Great Victory! Sixty-five years ago Nazism was vanquished. The machine that was wiping off whole nations was stopped. Peace returned to our country and to Europe as a whole. An end was put to the ideology that was destroying the fundamentals of civilization. The Soviet Union bore the brunt of the Fascist attack as they threw in three quarters of their troops to the Eastern Front. They wanted to scorch our land, but instead they met with resistance unparalleled in courage and strength. The defence of Moscow and Leningrad, the battle of Stalingrad, the battle of Kursk also known as the Kursk Bulge — these are not just the stages of that war. These are blood and tears, the anguish of defeat and the triumph of victory, wounds and the death of comrades-in-arms. And there was only one choice — either conquer the enemy or become slaves. This war has made us a strong nation. Every day, every hour, every minute people made decisions, both in battlefields and in the rear. And this particular feeling – being personally responsible for the fate of the country — our veterans have carried through their whole lives. They have taught us the main lesson. They have attained freedom. Time is very powerful, but not as powerful as human memory, our memory. We shall never forget soldiers who fought on fronts. Women, who replaced men in factories. Children, who suffered from ordeals inconceivable for their age. All of them are heroes of the war. The victory in 1945 was not only a military but also a great moral victory. A common victory. All of the Soviet Union’s peoples fought for it, and our allies helped to bring it closer. And today troops from Russia, the CIS countries and our allies in the anti-Hitler coalition will march together triumphantly. March in a single formation as a proof of our common desire to defend peace and never to allow any revision of the outcomes of war, never to let any new tragedies happen. The war has taken tens of millions of lives. Lives of people from many countries, people of different ages, nationalities and confessions. In Russia almost every family has suffered from the atrocities of war with family members or relatives either killed or missing, starving from hunger during the siege of Leningrad or killed in concentration camps. That cannot be tolerated. That cannot be forgotten. Memory is eternal. Dear friends, The lessons of World War II call us to solidarity. The world is still fragile, and we should remember that wars do not start in a flash. The evil gains its strength if we shrink back or try to ignore it. Only together can we counteract modern threats. Only based on the principles of good-neighbourliness can we resolve issues of global security so that ideals of justice and of the good can triumph in the whole world and life of future generations can be free and happy. Dear veterans, Sixty-five years ago you won peace for our country and for the whole world. You have given us the most precious gift — an opportunity to live. We bow our heads in respect for you. I congratulate you on the holiday! I congratulate you on the Victory Day! All Honour to the winners! Hurrah!;2010;NO;NO;NO;Random Speech;662;NO;
5101;"Colleagues, Mr Churov, good afternoon, I am very happy to see you. Our meeting is taking place as we approach the New Year, and I would like to begin by extending my warmest greetings and wishing you success and prosperity. Now, of course, let us touch upon our joint work. Together with Mr Churov [Chairman of the Central Election Commission] we have been planning this meeting for quite some time, but kept putting it off until we reached the end of the year. We intended to have this meeting right after the September election campaign. I would like to thank you for it. I know that we have here representatives of various electoral commissions: from the Central Election Commission to district electoral commissions. Of course, those who work at the grassroots level tend to bear the brunt of this job, and I know you had every opportunity to experience this because almost all of the 54 parties that had the right to take part in elections at that time were represented this year. I would like to note here that representatives of 46 parties are currently working on the electoral commissions, which makes the work of these commissions more legitimate and creates greater trust in election results. I also know that you have started consultations with the parties that take part in election campaigns, giving clarifications regarding applicable legislation. I find it extremely important for people to know and understand their rights and to be able to organise their activities within the framework of applicable legislation. And, finally, we have reformed all the election committees, now they are all formed for a period of five years. This is also very important and substantial from the point of view of improving our political system, including its election side. Today I would like to talk to you, to hear your views regarding your work in the outgoing year and your plans for the near term. I would like to hear what you think should be done additionally to make our electoral system more open, so that nobody has any doubt that it is operating on the highest possible organisational level and in the most up-to-date civilised political manner; that it is transparent, that it treats equally all those who are seeking the joy of being elected to all bodies of power, that it observes the rights of all participants of the election process. <…>";2013;NO;NO;NO;Random Speech;446;NO;
6988;Good afternoon, colleagues, Today we have gathered in the Voronezh Region to discuss further development of Russia’s agriculture. First, I would like to note that the Voronezh Region is one of the absolute leaders in terms of agricultural growth. Its growth rate is impressive and stands at 9 percent for the past nine months. I do not think we will see such growth anywhere else. Overall, the Voronezh Region is one of the top five regions and it is seeing impressive growth. Apart from crop production, livestock breeding and dairy production are on the rise. The region is number one for milk. Well done, congratulations. Do you object? Are your figures higher? It will, definitely, if you keep working as hard as before. Absolutely. Therefore, I would like to thank all industry professionals and everybody who works in agriculture for their achievements this year. Despite unfavourable weather conditions in some regions, we are expecting a good grain crop this year. Moreover, it promises to set a record in Russia’s history and reach almost 130 million tonnes. We have spoken about this repeatedly but I cannot help but mention this once again. Let me remind you that in 2016 we harvested 120.7 million tonnes but it was still lower than the 1978 harvest when the Russian SFSR produced 127.4 million tonnes. We expect a good harvest of sugar beet and other vegetables, as well as oil-plants and other crops. In 2017, we hope to gather in 52 million tonnes of sugar beet, up from 51.4 million tonnes last year, and 16.4 million tonnes of other vegetables, up from 16.3 million tonnes. The increase in the harvest of other crops is comparable. Livestock production continues to grow. It amounted to 4.4 percent in the first eight months of 2017. Overall, we can report sustainable positive dynamics in agriculture. It has become a modern industry, an attractive investment destination and a growth driver of the national economy. I recall the debates we held in the early 2000s, when everyone said that agriculture is like a black hole and that any investment in it disappears without a trace or any result. The situation has changed radically since then. The average growth rate in agriculture in 2014–2016 was 3.6 percent. Our producers have strengthened their positions on the domestic market and have also increased their export potential. According to the Federal Customs Service, the agricultural industry increased exports by 18.8 percent, to $10 billion, in the first seven months of the year. Grains have been our staple export commodity so far. Importantly, the exports structure has become more diversified. Russia is actively increasing its exports of meat, sugar, and sunflower oil. Prospects are good for promoting deep processed products with high added value. This area is certainly one that we need to focus on. It is likewise gratifying to note that, in our international dealings, we now have to devote considerable space to issues pertaining to promotion of our meat products on foreign markets. In particular, promoting pork, poultry, or grain, for that matter, is now a separate discussion item in our negotiations. For example, 18 million tonnes of grain were exported in the first seven months of 2017 alone, which is 15.4 percent up from last year. However, there are other figures that are truly impressive. During the same period, sugar exports grew by 52 times, pork exports went up 83 percent, poultry 32 percent, and sunflower oil 34 percent. Overall, we should continue to support exports, and to remove infrastructural and logistics barriers, in particular on the grain market. Exporting grain from many Russian regions is still economically unviable because of prohibitive transportation costs. We have discussed this with the Agriculture Minister, and I will talk about our proposals at the end of my remarks. Of course, these costs come from high transportation rates. I am aware that the Agriculture Ministry and the Government in general are working on this issue. Today, we will agree upon what should be done in this area, and how we should proceed. I would like to focus particularly on veterinary safety, which is critical for human health, and the effective promotion of our products on the domestic and foreign markets. Keeping tabs on the African swine fever should be one of our areas of focus. This is an important prerequisite for our producers’ credibility with Russian and foreign consumers alike. We have achieved significant growth in many sectors of our agro-industrial complex due to import replacement. However, problems remain. Our dependence on foreign seeds and breeding stock is still high. Clearly, such a problem cannot be resolved overnight. It will take time, many years of study and research. We need a clear action plan to focus our attention and apply our resources to the development of selection and genetic diversity in Russia. They constitute the basis of the national food security. The work to create a selection and genetic fund will proceed within the framework of the Federal Scientific and Technical Programme of Agricultural Development for 2017–2025. Increasing the output of products with of a high degree of processing is a major aspect of agricultural development, combined with the creation of new jobs, as well as additional income and taxes collected for the national budget.  Today we will discuss the development of agricultural cooperatives. On January 1, 2017, we had 5,839 agricultural cooperatives in the country. The best results in this area were reported in the Lipetsk and Tyumen regions and in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).  Cooperative farming allows small companies to increase production and receive assistance when it comes to farming equipment, tilling land and marketing produce. Ultimately, this helps increase people’s incomes and improve living standards and is a major factor in enhancing employment, developing farmland and settling urgent social issues. However, the level of involvement of small farms in agricultural cooperatives remains low. We would like to learn today about practical plans to improve the situation in this area. Now I will get to the point, as we say in such situations. While congratulating ourselves on a rich or a record large harvest, we must be aware of the economic consequences of this. I hope we will talk about this in detail today. What I mean is that oversupply usually leads to a decline in prices. We should analyse this possibility. Practical proposals have been formulated, and I discussed them with the Finance Minister and his deputy. I would like to remind you that I had instructed the Government to increase allocations to agriculture in addition to the approved budgetary spending of 20 billion rubles. The Government has augmented the 2018 budget, and these funds can be used to fulfil two tasks. First, we must continue to subsidise the interest rates on agricultural loans, and second, we need to subsidise the railway transportation of grain, so that grain holds competitive positions both on the domestic and foreign markets regardless of the region in which it was produced. As the Agriculture Minister said, and I hope he will repeat this in his report, this money will suffice for the fulfilment of these tasks.  I would like the Minister to speak about this in greater detail. Let us begin with his report. Mr Tkachev, please. Indonesia is a Muslim country. They do not eat pork there. They won’t. Thank you, Mr Tkachev. I would like to single out a couple of issues. First, we are talking about continuing the subsidies of both Russian Railways shipments and interest rates on bank loans out of those additional 20 billion. There is another component I want to draw your attention to. You saw that yesterday some of the colleagues present here and I met with German business leaders. Some of them consider themselves, and quite legitimately so, to be Russian producers because in agricultural equipment production, say, they reached the level of domestic manufacturing required from them by the Russian Government. They have posed a question on behalf of all Russian agricultural producers regarding the extension of subsidies on agricultural equipment. Mr Dvorkovich proposed 2 billion out of those 20, and I think this is the right thing to do, just for your information. We know that these subsidies are not at your Ministry, they are handled by the Ministry of Industry, but to avoid inconsistency, this is also an agricultural sector, also needed for agricultural production, so let us keep it in mind. This is the first point. Thank you very much. Now the second point, regarding selection and genetics. The programme I mentioned earlier covers both seeds and genetics, but why is it scheduled until 2025? Why so long? Did you make any estimates? All right. Concerning those “grey” or “black” imports from the countries that fall under sanctions: the most efficient way is expanding the application of electronic certificates. Unfortunately, very few of them are registered today, just 9 million electronic certificates per month whereas we need 300 million. Two tasks or two questions arise. First, we must have the capacity taking into account that this is a federal system. This should be taken care of beforehand. And preventive steps must be taken now so as not to face the situation when volumes are growing while the system cannot cope with them. The second component is a regional one. I would like to address heads of Russian regions – a great deal depends on you here and a large part of work is imposed on you. Meanwhile, in some regions this work is being done whereas in others it is almost absent. I would like you to pay attention to this problem and expedite its resolution. And now Mr Korolev of the Lipetsk Region, please, go ahead. Thank you very much. Mr Korolev, you were right to highlight the positive shifts, of course. They are tangible and evident in agriculture. This is what the achievements of the agricultural complex in the past years show. That is obvious. But in terms of many indicators, unfortunately, the situation is far from what we could consider good. As for the road network (I have cited the data recently), 80 percent of federal roads are at the level required by the standards, I believe. The figure for regional roads is lower, and municipal roads, which also include rural roads, are still in very poor condition. I am not saying that their state was better in the Soviet time, maybe it was even worse, I do not remember, but today’s situation in this sphere, in rural areas, definitely requires our close attention and must be rectified. The same applies to the number of beds in rural medical assistance centres and hospitals, even district ones. There are about 100 beds per 10,000 people in a city, and in a rural area there are only 40 beds per 10,000 people. This is the difference. As a result, life expectancy nationwide is 72.5 years, and in rural areas it is 70.5. That may not seem to be a big difference but it is there nevertheless. The same goes for income levels. I am not even talking about the number of cultural facilities per person or per 1,000 people, or 10,000 people. Their number in rural areas is much lower, without any doubt. We see the same with the level of incomes. That is why here, in social sphere, we have a lot of work to do together. But as for the developments in rural areas’ economy, they are certainly very encouraging, because if the rural economy produces such good results, then these are clearly the pre-requisites for developing the social sphere as well. We just must not forget that this has to be done on a mandatory basis. We must devote attention to this area both on the regional and the federal levels.  <…>;2017;YES;YES;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;2266;NO;
4995;"Good afternoon, colleagues, Our meeting is devoted to implementing state ethnic policy in Russian regions. The majority of them are characterised by ethno-cultural and religious diversity; this fact is well-known. And we shall discuss what is being done at the local level to ensure interethnic peace and accord. We have already established the good tradition of holding our Council’s meeting in a given Russian region. Today we are in Ufa, where we are celebrating the 225th anniversary of Catherine the Great’s decree establishing the Muslim Spiritual Assembly. This decision contributed to the self-organisation of Russia’s Muslim community and, of course, its fruitful development in order to serve society and our country. This event played an important, very important role in strengthening Russian statehood, contributed to creating a common spiritual and cultural space, and to establishing the values and traditions that unite us. It is our duty to preserve this unique heritage, support interethnic harmony, and respond adequately and competently to new, contemporary challenges and problems. Colleagues, we identified specific areas for joint work at the Council’s first meeting. They were integrated into the National Ethnic Policy Strategy through to 2025, approved in December 2012. The Government has adopted the relevant implementation plan for 2013–2015, and the programme Strengthening the Unity of the Russian Nation and the Ethnic and Cultural Development of the Peoples of Russia, which provides funding for regional programmes. For the first time we are using a so-called targeted programme approach to addressing ethnic issues. This was an initiative of our Council members; they suggested it at our meeting in Saransk. It is laid out in the documents I just mentioned. Today, special importance is given to active, meaningful efforts taken at the local level, and regional and municipal authorities’ strive to enforce the new National Ethnic Policy Strategy, taking into account, of course, each territory’s specific nature and unique qualities. However, we must admit that this work has been progressing too slowly so far; plans for implementing the federal Strategy have included only one third of the Russian Federation’s regions. Let me repeat, we are talking only about plans, about the first imperative measures, and if we analyse the actual work that has been done, things appear even more discouraging. In addition, 21 of Russia’s regions have adopted their own strategic documents. But here, too, the situation is suboptimal: most of the documents are clearly outdated. Russia is a federal state. We generally recommend that regions create their own plans or documents to supplement the federal ones. However, as you know, the Russian Constitution specifies that the federal structure is based on a consolidated system of state power, and this requires consistency and coordination of actions between all levels of authorities when resolving nationwide challenges. Interethnic relations certainly fit into this category. They are one of the most important, complex and sensitive issues requiring our close joint attention. We must remember that ethnic discord usually originates at a local level, in places where it needs to be blocked pre-emptively. Unfortunately, the heads of those regions often prefer office work, which is of little or no use, particularly if it is impossible for people to meet with the relevant administrators. For example, as you know, in Biryulevo, residents’ discontent had been building up for years. People complained to the police, to the local authorities and to district leaders. What are the authorities for if they do not want to know about the local situation, if they do not take any measures and are not hearing the people? All this leads to terrible conflicts, including on an ethnic and religious basis, as well as attempts to resolve those conflicts using unlawful means. It is also unacceptable to turn a blind eye to unlawful actions by foreign nationals who violate migration legislation and commit crimes. This, too, is clear; I have already spoken about it many times. Let me stress again that each area, market and home is the responsibility of an individual person, a specific leader, business proprietor or official. And it is unacceptable for anyone to eschew this responsibility. A few days ago, the Federation Council passed a law on identifying the powers of regional and municipal authorities and their responsibility in the occurrence of interethnic conflicts, with consequences that include the dismissal of administrators who are unable to prevent conflicts. The law has been signed. I have already stated at our Council meeting in Saransk that such conflicts often arise from day-to-day occurrences. And if people of different ethnicities are involved, these clashes can instantly be used by extremists, radical groups and individuals for fuelling ethnic tensions and achieving their selfish political aims. The media and online communities often pick up and propagate the hyped-up “ethnic” version and interpretation of the conflict. Thus, consciously or due to stupidity and professional incompetence, they make the situation even worse. I am certain that most of these conflicts could have been avoided if the local authorities had listened to the people’s requests and opinions and resolved the problems that occur fairly and promptly. Let me repeat: one-time emergency measures to prevent interethnic conflicts are ineffective. We need modern, system-wide measures and approaches that are reflected in the new National Ethnic Policy Strategy. It will come into full force only when it is sought after by the regions, when it becomes a real guide to action, to painstaking, systematic efforts to strengthen interethnic harmony. Let me stress that regional plans for implementing the National Ethnic Policy Strategy must be substantive, reflecting the needs and particularities of each specific area. Nobody is ever in need of empty paperwork, and it is particularly true in this case. It is also imperative to create a system for monitoring interethnic relations and assessing risks and measures for preventing possible conflicts on a common, methodical basis. Here, the role of the academic and expert community is quite important. A research centre has already been created following my instructions to monitor interethnic relations in Southern Russia and the Volga Federal District. I believe every region should use the rich potential of our academic community and engage in dialogue with civil society institutions and ethnic and cultural associations. I want to once again ask the Plenipotentiary Envoys to the federal districts to do more than just track and monitor the situation. We need to help regional and municipal authorities analyse the state of affairs in interethnic matters and work with them to resolve difficult problems, if they occur. Particular attention should be given to employment issues. The people appointed as deputy governors and those responsible for interethnic relations should have a modern understanding of this area and should be capable of putting together a team of competent administrators, establishing direct dialogue with individuals and public associations. All this requires outstanding personal skills and extensive professional expertise. Colleagues, let’s discuss the concrete measures needed in order to train and retrain government and municipal officials working in the field of interethnic relations and migration policy. In recent years, we have seen a trend of increasing tension in the relations between local residents and migrants. This is true for both immigrants from other countries and people relocating from various regions within Russia. Today, the Federal Migration Service and the Regional Development Ministry are responsible for helping migrants adapt and integrate. But we must admit that we are seeing few positive changes in this area. Meanwhile, we must work more actively on a local level. Perhaps we should consider drawing up labour maps that outline the needs of Russian regions for additional labour. However, the greatest attention should be given to migrants’ social adaptation and creating the necessary conditions to achieve this. Such adaptation centres have been established in Tambov and Orenburg, and according to initial expert assessments, they can provide good results. In conclusion, I want to talk about the suggestion to create an annual nationwide public award For Contributions to Strengthening National Unity in Russia. I think this can be a good incentive for people whose work relates to the crucial and highly sensitive field that is interethnic relations. Let’s begin our work. <…> Let’s round things up now. I want to thank you for our work together and for this discussion. Let me say a few words in conclusion. I will not get into a debate with some of the participants in today’s meeting, though the urge to argue was certainly there. However, we are here not to argue but to listen to what each of us has to say and carry out the proposals that you come up with in our practical work through the presidential bodies and the Russian Federation Government. The subject we are dealing with is a very big issue not just for Russia but for practically all developed countries. You know how serious these problems are in Europe, North America and other parts of the world. Some of our colleagues in Europe have spoken of their ethnic policy’s failure over the last decade. We cannot allow ourselves to even contemplate such an outcome because Russia is a multi-ethnic country. I met today with Muslim spiritual leaders and said what I have repeated on many occasions, namely, that our Muslims are Russians, our citizens, and this is their only home. We can say the same of every people living in the Russian Federation. Russia is the biggest part, but nonetheless only a part of the former homeland that we all shared, the Soviet Union. That we developed as a multi-ethnic and multi-faith country does create some problems, but it also gives us unquestionable huge advantages. We therefore must make use of all the positive experience and good things that were built up over these decades, make use of our advantages as a multi-ethnic and multi-faith country, which should give us a solid foundation for development.  Certainly there are problems, quite serious ones too. Unfortunately, we see that there is a lack of ability and sometimes even a reluctance to put things in order and find competent solutions. This lack of ability comes from the fact that we never knew such problems in the past because we lived in a single big country without any borders between us. Now we have borders and we have become separate countries. We have visa-free travel at present. We can consider the introduction of visas, but the question is, would this make things any better? Another problem is that the corruption that we rightly discussed here today could move from the markets to the borders instead. The issue is one of resolving the problems we have been talking about today in professional, competent and firm fashion. I cannot but agree with the colleagues who say that we must improve our labour laws. This is indeed the case. What we are seeing, after all, is more like wild capitalism letting out another belch – forgive the crude metaphor – something not much different to the auctions for shares that were carried out with assets at one time. Using cheap migrant labour is above all an economic problem. But there is certainly a need for firm, consistent and civilised measures to put the situation in order. We can and must achieve results here. I do not think that we have any problems we cannot overcome. They are all issues that can be resolved. But to do this, we first need to think and to set out our proposals. This is why we are meeting today. I thank you very much for taking part not only in today’s meeting but also for your involvement in general in reflecting on these problems and looking for solutions. It probably won’t be possible to implement every proposal, but we will analyse them, sort through them and will give practical implementation to feasible ideas.  Thank you very much.";2013;YES;YES;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;2230;NO;
3911;"Good afternoon, I want to say first of all that I have a special feeling towards the Order of Parental Glory. Of all our country’s state decorations it is perhaps the one infused with the most goodness and humanity. This is the fourth time the decoration is being presented here at the Kremlin. We are presenting it today to the parents of large families. We have established what we think is now a very good tradition of meeting here at the Kremlin all together, parents and children, and having the whole family present for the ceremony. I want to congratulate you all on these state decorations, and congratulate your children and your entire families too, of course. I will not take up much time saying just how great a priority support for motherhood and childhood is for our country. You understand this better than anyone. Our country has no future unless it has children, and strong families. The state authorities’ duty is do what we can to encourage the number of families such as yours to grow with every passing year. All the families here today are each unique in their own way of course, but if others follow your example this would be very useful for us all.  As you know, our demographic situation is not very good, unfortunately, although some of the state programmes we have been carrying out, such as the maternity capital and other social undertakings, have helped to increase the number of families with two or more children. I will name one figure because it really is a good result. The number of births has increased by almost a quarter over the last five years, and this is a good development. This news is all the better in that almost half of these births are second or subsequent children. This is tremendously important for Russia today, so that our country can develop and get its demographic situation back to normal. We will definitely continue these programmes. You all know very well that it is not enough just to give birth to children; they also need education, need to grow up happy and healthy and have the chance to learn. This is parents’ mission, and it is a sometimes very difficult mission indeed, because raising children is hard enough as it is, all the more so when there are many of them. It is a job that requires a lot of moral and physical effort, not to mention the material difficulties involved too. The state authorities’ job is to help in this task by creating the right conditions. What conditions am I talking about? You know yourselves that this is above all decent healthcare, decent food, not just at home, but also in schools and kindergartens, and opportunities for children to enjoy proper holidays, preferably together with their parents. I note that today’s ceremony takes place as we mark International Children’s Day. Unfortunately, the world is such that children face many threats in modern life. We all have a lot of work to do to make our world a safer place for our children, a more caring and attentive place, where they are protected not just by the law, but by a normal environment in the country and general support for families and children. Present here today are families from the different federal districts. Some of you have up to 13 children. This deserves tremendous respect of course. The older children help to look after the younger ones, but most important, you are passing on the desire to found and build modern and happy families, and this really is the very foundation of our life. Friends, I wish you all health and happiness. I hope that all of the children here today – though some of them are already quite grown up – are successful in life, achieve their dreams, and get the education or work that they desire. This would be the best gift for their parents. Let’s begin presenting the decorations now. <…> Friends, parents, children, The state decorations have been presented now. I want to say once again that this is a ceremony full of warmth, but a very official ceremony at the same time, for we are here today in one of the Kremlin’s finest halls, where state receptions take place and state decorations are presented. Of course, it is a great pleasure that it is you who have received these decorations today. As we heard from some of you just now, life can be a complex thing, not always easy. It is true that big families often do not receive the attention they need, and it can be hard to resolve the problems that face any family, all the more so large families. I think that the very fact that this ceremony is taking place should help to draw more attention to you. Whose attention exactly? First of all, that of the authorities at all levels, because help in building strong families is the responsibility not of any one single person, not the president or any other high official, but of the authorities in their entirety, at every level and in every region and district of our country. Officials at every level need to make efforts to support big families and support families, motherhood and childhood in general. That today’s ceremony is taking place on a special day – International Children’s Day – is another chance to draw the attention of all officials to the problems facing children and families, and I hope they will respond accordingly. Perhaps no less important, as I said, this ceremony is also the chance for those who only plan to found their families to see the wonderful example you set. Families come in all shapes and sizes. Some are bigger and some are smaller. But the goal of any family is to have children, and the more children there are, the better it is for Russia, and for the families themselves. I hope that your example will inspire millions of other Russian families. Thank you for everything you have done for our country.";2011;YES;NO;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;1138;NO;
831;Gentlemen, I am very happy to welcome you, the representatives of the most diverse nations and regions in the world, as you begin your diplomatic work in this country. Your mission here, in Russia, is both responsible and very interesting. I expect that both the high authority you have been given, and your personal efforts, will serve to strengthen bilateral ties and become an important support in coordinating the efforts of our countries and people in fighting contemporary challenges and threats. And we know well what these challenges and threats are. The recent tragic events in Turkey showed once again: international terrorism is not decreasing its activity. It strikes in virtually every part of the world. Therefore, we can only realistically oppose this threat by creating an effective mechanism of practical coordination. I would like to repeat once again something that I have said several times before: we need unity in fighting such threats as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organised crime and drug trafficking. Solving such global problems as hunger, epidemics and environmental threats also requires the closest possible cooperation. Russia’s relations with the countries that you represent are based on partnership and the aspiration to develop cooperation. Russia and Brazil are linked by traditional friendship. Today, Russian-Brazilian friendship is characterised by its dynamic, intensive and very trusting contacts at various levels. All this creates good conditions to deepen and widen bilateral ties. The relations between Russia and the Austrian Republic are determined by the spirit of good neighbourliness. We dynamically develop bilateral political dialogue, trade and economic ties, and investment cooperation. We have productive ties in culture, science and education. Russia counts on close cooperation in future with Austria in the united Europe that is taking shape. Russia highly values the traditions of friendship and mutual understanding with the Republic of the Philippines. Our diplomatic relations have existed for more than a quarter of a century, and this is a good start to building close and effective cooperation. We have good prospects to take Russian-Philippine relations to an even higher level and to expand cooperation on the international arena. This also concerns our joint activity on ensuring security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Traditional ties of friendship connect Russia and Mauritania. At the base of these ties are mutual respect and trust, a desire to strengthen cooperation in international and regional affairs, and the development of bilateral cooperation. I am sure that we will be able to add additional dynamics to Russian-Mauritanian ties in the trade and economic area. I am also truly happy to welcome the ambassador of the French Republic. Relations between our countries are currently developing more dynamically than ever before. Strategic partnership makes it possible to interact effectively on the most important and complex problems of the modern world. The non-traditional bilateral mechanism created on the initiative of the President of France, has justified its hopes – the Council of Cooperation on Security Issues. I am sure that with joint efforts we will be able not just to maintain the high level of political dialogue, but also to develop new promising directions in our cooperation. I can also note with pleasure the positive dynamics in relations with the Kingdom of Bahrain. I hope that this will allow us to ensure the further development of Russian-Bahrainian interaction, and widen the practical component of our cooperation. We also have prospects of taking the traditionally friendly ties between Russia and the Republic of Burundi to a higher level. We intend to increase the potential of bilateral interaction, including on the international arena. We support swift regulation of the internal conflict in Burundi, and are prepared to cooperate here with all interested parties. Gentlemen, I believe that closer coordination of the positions and actions of our nations, and the growth of mutual trust, is in the common interests of our peoples. By working together, we can make the world safer and more stable. I wish you success in the start of your official mission in Russia. Here you will always find the necessary support of initiatives that serve to strengthen bilateral and multilateral interaction. I hope that your time in Moscow will be useful and fruitful, and I have no doubt that it will be interesting. I wish you all the best. Thank you for your attention.;2003;YES;NO;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;806;NO;
8653;"Good afternoon. All of you are well-disciplined, everyone is wearing a face mask. Well, there is nothing we can do about this requirement of the time. Nevertheless, I can see and recognise all of you, and I would like to greet and welcome you at our today’s meeting.  I am happy to meet with you and to congratulate you on Russian Parliamentarism Day. Congratulations, everyone. Almost 115 years ago, the first State Duma meeting opened here at the Tauride Palace. This is not just a memorable date, but an important milestone in the development of Russian statehood.  Colleagues,  I would like to thank you for your caring and respectful attitude towards parliamentary traditions that rest on high patriotic ideals and values and a striving to honestly, openly and proactively discharge your duty to the people and our Motherland.  Just like in the early 20th century, parliamentarians of modern Russia represent various political forces. But I am convinced that deputies at all levels, as well as senators, have always prioritised our country’s national interests, and that they will continue to do this in the future. This is the most solid foundation for consolidation, for our joint and well-coordinated work to achieve strategic goals of Russia’s development, for accomplishing key tasks facing society and the state in the economy, ecology, demography and, most importantly, in improving our citizens’ living standards and quality of life. As you know, the Address to the Federal Assembly contains specific guidelines on these areas. Colleagues, in this context I very much count on our active work and your support. I rely on your vigorous, interested participation in implementing the proposed initiatives, their additional thorough expert analysis at your level and effective legislative support. Of course, I rely on continuous and meticulous parliamentary control without any favours, which is a very important part of our joint efforts. Much in this context depends on your ability to organise work at the Council of Legislators. It is necessary to coordinate and closely link the law-making plans of the Federal Assembly and the regional parliaments. You must develop a constructive dialogue with the Government of the Russian Federation, heads of the constituent entities and their teams. You know that a number of important initiatives in the Address are of strictly regional importance and are aimed at a comprehensive and balanced development of the Russian Federation territory and the consolidation of the financial base of the regions and municipalities. I will not go into details now. I am sure you have already looked into this problem and studied it inside out. I am referring primarily to the need to straighten regional budgets. To carry out large projects in the regions that are important for their residents, including via infrastructure budget loans that will be granted to the constituent entities for 15 years at an interest rate of no more than 3 percent. I would like to repeat that this is a new and powerful development tool, and I hope it will be powerful. It must start working for the benefit and in the interests of the people. Hence, priority investment areas and specific projects must be determined with due account for the opinions of the people that live there. I would like to ask you, colleagues, as a representative authority, to keep this issue under special, constant control and to strictly monitor the fulfilment of all the decisions made on social support for the people, and in part, families with children. You know that in addition to the existing benefits, together with you, we have, in fact, made these decisions on the consistent support of Russian families, in stages: first for children under three years, then from three to seven years old. You know, a new measure has been proposed: to introduce payments for children aged 8 to 16 who grow up in single-parent families. We all understand very well that children who grow up in such families are, unfortunately, in the most vulnerable position. This is not the last thing that we must do. Ms Golikova knows, we are working on these issues together. We will do everything step by step, but we will definitely do this. We will continue to build our programmes to support Russian families step by step. In this case, expectant mothers who find themselves in a difficult financial situation will also be able to receive monthly payments. Moreover, in August, as you know, we will make a one-time payment of 10,000 rubles to families with school-age children, including those who are due to start first grade on September 1. It is also clear why I mentioned this in my Address, distracting from the text: we proceed from the assumption that the labour market has not yet restored; unfortunately, unemployment is higher than the pre-crisis level, and although the trend is generally positive, the market has not restored yet. Real wages are growing slowly, but the level of Russian families’ income has still dropped during the pandemic, and families with school-age children need support in order to get their children ready for school on September 1, as they should. The system of providing various social benefits has been set in general. However, I would like to ask you to carry out your parliamentary monitoring of each of these measures. And respond immediately if a person faces any difficulties there. You know this because you work with people closely and I often hear that, despite all the tried and tested mechanisms, including those using up-to-date tools and methods, there are still failures. If people cannot get what they are entitled to by law, it is necessary to respond as quickly as possible. Please use the entire arsenal of deputy and senatorial tools in order to quickly get to the bottom of the problem and help each and every citizen in such cases. In the end, the analysis and synthesis of such practices help to improve the entire regulatory framework and the mechanisms used to provide any public or municipal services. The rules here must be fair and absolutely clear, and services simple and user-friendly. It is also important that they are available online and round-the-clock, which, as you know, was also mentioned in the Address. Colleagues, This autumn will be a time of federal parliamentary elections and important election campaigns will be held in dozens of constituent entities of the Federation, major cities and administrative centres. Many of you and your colleagues, current deputies of different levels, are going to take part in the election campaign. Please show respect to all your opponents, and compete fairly, transparently and in strict compliance with the law and political ethics. Here Russia should be a good example to others too. Avoid idle talk and cheap unsupported populism. You know how harmful it is. We constantly say: populism must be avoided. However, it persists in practice. Regretfully, we forget the negative experience of the past, including of the early 1990s. Empty promises were made, just to win the voters’ support. The result is that we cannot clear up some of the issues until now. What does it mean to promise something impossible? It means to arouse expectations which are never to be fulfilled, to deceive people and create mistrust in the entire country’s political system and rock it from the inside – that’s what it means. Please, do not bring back the situation the country faced in the 1990s, be responsible and honest with the people I am sure that responsible political forces will not let anybody act that way and Russian citizens will make their choice without servile, sometimes dangerous prompts from the outside, breeding strife in the society. Renewal of Russian authorities can only be ensured by direct and independent expression of our citizens’ will. Only they are entitled to decide who deserves to represent them, draft and adopt the laws by which the country should live. I hope that the tension of the election campaign and political rivalry will not disrupt the steady law-making process, will not slow it down and will not affect the quality of implementation of the plans either at the State Duma or the legislatures in the Russian Federation constituent entities. I expect all the plans to be realised by you in a professional manner and on time, including as part of our extensive joint work on implementing the Address. I know well that everyone present here makes such national goals a priority. Thank you for your highly responsible attitude. I wish you success in your parliamentary activity and congratulate you on the upcoming major national holiday – Victory Day.  Thank you very much for you attention. <…>";2021;YES;YES;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;1644;NO;
4807;"Good afternoon, colleagues, Today we are meeting again, as we did last year, about the 2014–2016 Budget Policy Address. I think it is necessary to draw your attention to several points and priorities. The main rationale behind budget policy is supporting economic growth. This is the main goal of our joint work. By what means should we achieve it? By radically improving the efficiency of our budget policy, unconditionally honouring all our commitments in the social sphere, and realising the strategic objectives defined in the executive orders of May 7, 2012. We need to switch to a long-term development policy in our public sector, and this means increasing the share of government spending on education, science and infrastructure, significantly improving the quality of social services, and stimulating business development and private investments. All of these objectives were mentioned in the previous Budget Policy Address, and some work in this direction has been conducted. Nevertheless, we must admit that new planning principles and measures to increase the efficiency of government spending are being introduced very slowly. We cannot wait and delay major decisions any longer. We need to achieve a new and better budgetary policy in the near future. These conditions determine our internal and external economic conditions and trends. At present, the possibilities of quickly and constantly increasing budgetary spending have been exhausted or close to it. We need more productive, superior solutions. Colleagues, what goals must we achieve over the coming three-year period? First, we must ensure a stable and balanced budgetary system as well as the unconditional fulfilment of government obligations, primarily social ones, even in the event of an unfavourable external economic environment. It is for precisely this reason that the budget rule was adopted. I consider it necessary to finalise our budget strategy through to 2030 over the next three months, and if necessary, we must make changes to long-term forecasts of socioeconomic development. The budget strategy must evaluate possible risks and clarify how we will act in any scenario, including an unfavourable one. It must also set out clear guidelines for financial support of government programmes: funds should be allocated for plans that really envisage transformations and in order to achieve specific targets. Unfortunately, this is not the first year (it is more like the fifth) that we have talked about the need to introduce a number of government programmes. We talked and talked, and then finally all the new members of the Government managed to gradually plan these programmes. Nevertheless many of them – you know this yourselves – need further development. The objectives they contain are not supported by adequate resources and some programs have been adopted in several versions. Moreover, these versions differ significantly both in terms of planned results and funding required. Friends and colleagues, if there are not enough funds to cover everything, then we need to set priorities. For this reason we have instituted these programmes. I would emphasise that, in practice, state programmes must dovetail with strategic and budgetary planning; they must establish general policy requirements for both federal departments and regions in their respective fields; and, they must ultimately become a tool for developing and implementing public policies in the long-term. I would ask that as you prepare the budget, you once again analyse government programmes, identify their priorities, and ensure that the latter correspond with the relevant goals and real possibilities afforded by budgetary funds. The second goal: we need to significantly optimise the budget’s structure, to find reserves and redistribute them in the light of the strategic objectives outlined in the executive orders of May 7, 2012. We should increase the amount of funds spent on areas that have the greatest impact on economic growth and social development. Important reserves can be generated by increasing the efficiency of budget spending, focusing on targeted social assistance, and carrying out structural reforms in the social sphere. Finally, they also depend on ensuring a long-term balanced budget for the pension system, which will reduce the Pension Fund’s dependence on government subsidies. This is conditional on the fact that the living standards of Russia’s older generation consistently improve. This is related to the third goal: making crucial decisions about a pension formula is a high-priority task. We’ve discussed this together many times, and I know that it’s a difficult task. In general we can say that you are almost there; we must see this work through to its end. A pension formula should allow for a differentiated approach to each citizen: the more years of service and the higher the salary, the higher the pension. And of course the formula must be fair, stable, transparent and, crucially, clearly understood by both employees and employers. Let me draw your attention to the following: we need to keep the basic rate of insurance premiums for businesses at current levels. We cannot solve the pension system’s problems by increasing the tax burden incumbent on business, and by suppressing entrepreneurial activity and economic growth. Depending on the final parameters of the pension formula, we should also indicate to what degree National Welfare Fund resources can be used to cover deficits in the pension system. Another thing I want to draw your attention to. We have given our citizens the right to decide over the course of this year on where to direct their four-percent insurance premiums: either to their insurance, or to the funded part of their pension. Naturally, it would be unfair to deprive those who will use the pension system in the future of this right. I think that they should benefit from this too. But I would draw everyone’s attention to the following: this will be possible only after adopting laws which fully, and I want to emphasise this, fully ensure the establishment of a functioning system to guarantee pension savings. We have enough problems with fraud victims to understand that with regards to ??pension savings, citizens’ pension rights, we must act extremely carefully. These funds should be guaranteed, as should their safety. We should also pay attention to problems relating to the transparency of the pension system and extra-budgetary funds. Let me remind you that as of January 1, 2014 all extra-budgetary funds will be transferred to the cash services of Federal Treasury agencies. I would ask you to prepare accordingly, and I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this date will not be postponed. And I would also ask the Government to decide on the feasibility of transferring the administrative aspects of compulsory insurance contributions to the Federal Tax Service. I know that the Government’s social bloc believes that this work should be conducted where it currently is, but representatives of businesses and of the economic bloc believe that the Federal Tax Service can do it more efficiently. I do not want to and will not impose my opinion on anyone, but I would ask you to definitively decide on this and bring these discussions to an end. Let me emphasise that the Government must make decisions this year, 2013, on all matters relating to further developing the pension system. The fourth goal. The Ministry of Finance was ready to put off funding for the State Arms Procurement Programme until a later date. We have adopted this programme; now we must carry it out, and do so efficiently. We have also talked about this many times. The resources have been allocated. Indeed, they are substantial, important resources. The military industry must be ready to accept the money, but not only that; it must have the appropriate industrial and technological foundation to fulfil contracts for supplying equipment and weapons. And if you see that some parts of the industry are not up to the task, the Defence Ministry must come up with its own plan for a more rational allocation of budgetary resources over time. This will give the Government the opportunity to use financial resources to address routine challenges more efficiently. At the same time, colleagues, I want to draw your attention to the following: of course, the total amount of the state arms programme, the total amount of funds we have allocated for it should remain unchanged. Fifth, we need to use additional mechanisms to stimulate economic growth, including by developing infrastructure. I am referring to using National Welfare Fund resources and pension money for sustainable infrastructure projects. This must generate a multiplier effect throughout the economy, as well as guarantee the absolute safety and recoverability of the funds. And of course we have to elaborate a single, clear mechanism for selecting such projects and allocating resources. Each project must undergo an independent technology audit and expert evaluation with the participation of business community representatives. At the same time, you need to create new tools for attracting private investment into infrastructure development, and using public-private partnership mechanisms. Of course, this is not an easy task. Recovering these funds will take time, this is not so-called fast money; these are serious long-term, long-lasting projects. And there are enough resources in the world, as you are well-aware: there are a large number of major international funds looking for opportunities to invest. Of course, generating profits is very important for them, but the most important thing is the unconditional repayment and reliability of such investments. Russia is able to offer such opportunities. Sixth. Each ruble spent by the Government should promote changes in the public sector. This is something we’ve already talked about a thousand times. It’s time to move to concrete actions and introduce new financial principles whereby money follows consumers of services, citizens, and does not simply enrich various offices. To do this, first of all we need to legislate a common reference list of state and municipal services, and to establish a uniform methodology for calculating the costs of such services. Along with this, the content of government tasks must be affiliated with the targets of government programmes. In this way our objectives in healthcare, education, culture and other priority sectors will be clear. Furthermore, one of our most important goals is to increase the competitiveness of our tax system. We are now adopting a whole set of measures to improve the business climate and make our national jurisdiction more appealing. This includes making tax payment procedures more convenient for businesses. Domestic entrepreneurs and international experts have noted this. We must continue to create stimuli for both Russian and foreign businesses, investing our resources into the creation of new factories within our nation. We will soon be implementing suggestions on tax benefits for investment into the Far East and supporting the development and exploitation of new extractable resource deposits, including the continental shelf. We should continue to simplify tax management, bringing it as closely in line as possible with business accounts, and generally improve the quality of our tax administration. At the same time, we need to limit people’s ability to mitigate taxes on a legal basis and transfer profits to offshore accounts, as well as to increase the financial burden on owners of prestigious, expensive property. In short, we must create tax conditions such as to ensure that investing money into Russia is more advantageous than hiding it on some island or spending it on luxury items. Seventh, our joint work with the regions to carry out the executive orders of May 7, 2012 has once again demonstrated the need to change the fiscal relations system. Based on the figures from 2012, the state debt in nearly one out of three regions is equal to over half of its revenue. At the same time, the share of investment spending is declining. In this regard, I feel it is essential for us to conduct constant monitoring of the financial situation in Russian regions, as well as the municipal districts, including such basic indicators as changes in key parameters of their budgets, the structure of their spending, and state and municipal debt. Corresponding measures should be taken based on the results of this monitoring. And it is important for the measures to be taken in a timely manner. At the same time, Russian regions must have the opportunity to plan their work without worrying about constant changes in the “rules of the game,” on the basis of a clear volume of co-financing provided from the federal budget. This will be particularly true when every region will be required to pass three-year budgets, starting next year. And finally, eighth. We must assure extensive transparency and openness in the budget process for our citizens. This is one of the key conditions for increasing the efficacy of state investments and the entire budget policy. We have been able to achieve significant results in this area: Russia is now in the top ten nations according to the International Budget Partnership’s budget transparency index. But this work certainly needs to be continued. Beginning this year, in 2013, all levels of government – federal, regional, municipal – must issue the Budgets for Citizens publication. They must use a format that is accessible and clear to average citizens to show the objectives being funded by state resources, the volume of funding used, the intended results and the actual results, in order for citizens to independently draw conclusions about the efficacy of the spending, targeted use of funds, and the overall efficacy of the work by the government. As far as the draft federal budget for 2014 and the planning period for 2015–2016 are concerned, the Government was supposed to have organised work with participation by experts to analyse the efficacy of budgetary spending and present suggestions for its optimisation, in accordance with January’s instructions. The results of this analysis should be reflected in the draft budget. I hope, colleagues, that this is precisely what will happen. We are entering a decisive phase in preparing the budget for the next three-year period. I expect the closest, most constructive possible cooperation between the Cabinet and the parliament, including all political parties. Let me stress again: it is imperative that we have a budget oriented toward development, a budget that will assure the resolution of all priority challenges that our nation faces. Naturally, we repeat this often, and I do it as well, but I will say it again: all these objectives, including the social ones, can be achieved and resolved only by assuring rapid economic growth. And in conclusion: unfortunately, we often consider priority objectives in the social and economic domains separately from budget policy issues. This is simply wrong. Developing areas should be fully reinforced through sources of funding. In turn, analysing the results achieved will allow us to objectively assess our efficacy in the use of government resources. In this regard, I feel it would be expedient to make the Budget Address a component of the Address to the Federal Assembly, and I am asking the Cabinet to prepare corresponding amendments to the legislation so that once a year, the President can set corresponding objectives, and the parliament and Cabinet can focus on these priorities from the very start. <…>";2013;YES;YES;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;2841;NO;
8988;"Mr President, colleagues, I would like to begin by thanking the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, Mr Jair Bolsonaro for accepting my invitation to come to Russia on an official visit. This is the President’s first visit to Russia. Let me note that relations between Russia and Brazil have traditionally been based on friendship and understanding. The strategic partnership between the two countries includes many diverse areas. Together, we want to develop political, economic and cultural ties, and cooperate closely on the global stage, at the UN, in BRICS, and in the G20, among others. And today we have had quite substantive and constructive talks. Following the talks, we adopted a joint statement that sets the guidelines for the further development of Russian-Brazilian cooperation. Our countries are definitely interested in progressively expanding economic interaction. Brazil is one of Russia’s leading trade partners in Latin America and the Caribbean, accounting for one third of all our trade with this region. Last year, bilateral trade grew by 87 percent despite coronavirus-related complications. The intergovernmental commission plays an important role in strengthening bilateral trade and investment ties. The latest session was held in autumn of last year in Brasilia. At that time, under personal instructions from President Bolsonaro, key Brazilian government ministers in the economic sector, responsible for energy, the mining industry and agriculture, visited Russia. In addition, we plan to soon hold a meeting of the High-Level Russian-Brazilian Commission co-chaired by the Russian Prime Minister and the Brazilian Vice President. The Russian-Brazilian and Brazilian-Russian Councils of Entrepreneurs are working well together; they have timed a series of meetings of business representatives to the current visit by the President of Brazil, and tonight Mr Bolsonaro will speak with the business leaders on these councils. Let me emphasise that Brazil is always widely represented at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Last year, Mr Bolsonaro greeted the participants of the SPIEF plenary session via videoconference, which we highly appreciated. Once again, I would like to thank you, Mr President, for your attention to our event in St Petersburg. We expect that this year’s 25th forum, scheduled for June 15–18, will be attended by a high-profile delegation of Brazilian politicians, business leaders and public activists. We note with satisfaction that our bilateral industrial cooperation is successfully expanding. And I would like to highlight the projects involving the Russian corporation Power Machines to modernise the Brazilian hydropower industry, as well as the Severstal and AVISMA projects to supply components for Brazilian high-tech industries. Russia’s Rosatom exports fuel for Brazilian nuclear power plants and radioisotopes for medical purposes. Rosatom is also interested in participating in the construction of new power units in Brazil, including low-capacity nuclear power plants, both land and floating plants, because it has unique and extensive experience, and technologies that are not available elsewhere in the world.  Cooperation in the chemical industry and the production of environmentally friendly mineral fertiliser is progressing at a good pace. In 2021, Russian companies supplied almost 10 million tonnes of fertilisers worth about $3.5 billion to the Brazilian market. Roscosmos and the Brazilian Space Agency are working on the implementation of the agreement on cooperation on the BRICS Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation. Three GLONASS stations have already been built in Brazil, as well as an electronic optical orbital debris spotter, and there are agreements to deploy two additional stations. Russian-Brazilian cooperation in medicine and pharmaceuticals has been gaining momentum of late. Our companies ChemRar and BIOCAD are active in promoting coronavirus and cancer drugs in the Brazilian market. A project to localise Sputnik V vaccine manufacturing in Brazil is being implemented with support from the Russian Direct Investment Fund. During our talks with President Bolsonaro, we naturally discussed the issues of cultural interaction. We agreed to continue promoting bilateral education, cultural and sports exchanges.  For example, a range of initiatives are being worked out now for Russia to participate in the celebrations of the bicentenary of Brazil’s independence later this year.  I will also mention that Russia provides assistance to Brazil in personnel training. We have about 400 Brazilian students in Russia, about 80 of whom are studying tuition-free.  A Russian-Brazilian inter-cultural school has recently been opened in Rio de Janeiro where classes are taught in Russian and Portuguese. You may also recall that a Bolshoi Theatre school has been operating for over 20 years in the Brazilian city of Joinville. Over 250 young people from different areas of Brazil and other Latin American countries train at this unique school, the only one of its kind outside Russia. While sharing opinions on regional and global issues, the parties stated that Russia’s and Brazil’s positions on many issues are close or overlap. The foreign and defence ministries maintain contact. Actually, the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries had their first ever meeting in the 2+2 format in Moscow this morning. Our countries advocate the development of a multipolar world order based on international law with the central coordinating role of the UN. Given that, we are firmly committed to the principle of multilateralism and the political-diplomatic settlement of conflicts. In view of Brazil’s status as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2022–2023, we are set to pursue our interaction more intensively across all current issues on the UN agenda.  And we will, of course, continue to cooperate with our Brazilin partners within BRICS – a respected international association that holds an important place in the contemporary multipolar world and plays an important role in the global economy. To conclude, I would like to thank Mr Bolsonaro for our meeting. I believe that today’s talks will serve to further strengthen Russian-Brazilian relations to the benefit of our two peoples. And finally, Mr President, I know of yesterday’s disaster in Brazil: heavy rains caused destruction and claimed lives. I want to express my condolences to you and to all the people of Brazil over this tragedy and to wish a speedy recovery to the injured.  Thank you for your attention. President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro     Bolsonaro JairPresident of Brazil  (retranslated): Mr President, We talked for almost two hours; the agenda was extensive and of great interest to both our countries. I am grateful to you for your condolences. People in Petropolis and Rio de Janeiro were affected by this natural disaster. Thank you. Mr President, we share common values: faith in God and protecting family values. We stand in solidarity with all countries that seek and do all they can to achieve peace.  We work together closely at such international venues as BRICS, the G20 and the UNO where we defend the sovereign right of nations to self-determination in line with the UN Charter and international law.  We noted the return of bilateral trade to pre-pandemic levels. Brazil is a major player in agriculture and we are pleased to see that there is interest in fertiliser supplies. We also see interested in supplies of animal-based products. We have vast potential for developing cooperation in the sphere of oil, petroleum products and natural gas. We are striving to strengthen our high-level dialogue on oil exploration and production in deep-water deposits. We are interested in small nuclear power plants. We are pleased to note the holding of the first military-political consultations between our foreign and defence ministers. We are very happy that the Amazon is part of humanity’s heritage and we are grateful to you for your words in defence of our sovereignty. Thank you very much. President Putin and I consider very important the efforts to create new dynamics in the technological alliance between Brazil and Russia. We are paying significant attention to nanotechnology, biotechnology, IT and medical research. Brazil and Russia have the world’s biggest forests and we decided to establish a dialogue on forest protection. Our meeting that lasted for almost two hours, I repeat, was very productive. It shows that two big powers have enormous potential for progress for the benefit of our nations. Let me repeat that the world is our home and God is above us. We stand for peace and are ready to support all those who do the same. We support all. Mr Putin, thank you very much for the warm welcome, the issues we discussed at today’s meeting and the trust placed in our country.  Thank you very much.";2022;YES;YES;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;1598;NO;other orgs like G20 are mentioned but not NATO
233;For Russia, mutually beneficial partnerships with Europe have been its traditional foreign policy priority. This was stressed once again in last year’s concept of Russia’s foreign policy. Russia has always felt it is part of European civilisation. We share with it a common history and long-established political, economic and cultural ties. Ancient Rus, you may recall, was known for its fabled Viking-Greek trade route linking the north and south of medieval Europe. We have cultivated our cooperation for centuries and now, I am sure, there is more to add to it.  The European Union is exercising a growing influence on our continent. It is therefore quite logical that we should pay very close attention to coordination of efforts with the EU. We treasure the trusting nature of our political dialogue with the European Union. I am convinced that new areas of EU work will enrich it. I am referring above all to defence and security. Together we could put up a more effective front against such threats as crime, corruption, terrorism and extremism.  Today the European Union is our largest trading partner, which accounts for more than one-third of Russian foreign trade. And as the EU expands, so will our trade. Now, countries of the European Union are Russia’s key negotiators on its entry into the World Trade Organisation. A Russia-EU agreement on cooperation in science and technology was signed last November, making it a major event. We are jointly preparing ground for cooperation in such a forward-looking area as power production. True, our relations are not uncontroversial, particularly in the context of EU expansion and its effect on our trade and economic ties and their development. But I think a partnership derives its quality from the ability to solve jointly and in a business-like way problems as they arise. I think Russia and the EU have such an ability. And this must play a positive role in the development of Russia-EU relations in the strategic perspective.  We are not drumming up our entry into the European Union. But very close cooperation on a lasting contractual basis adequate to the demands of time will, I am sure, meet our common interests. I believe our EU colleagues think alike.  The expansion of the EU is evidence of mounting integrative processes in Europe. They benefit all European countries. But we want to be assured that Russia’s interests will not suffer, and that new artificial barriers will not be erected to fragment Europe’s single political, social and economic space. That is why we are engaged in permanent dialogue with the European Union on these matters and firmly expect to reach agreed decisions before the European Union admits new members. I would like to emphasise that our negotiations are not concerned with EU enlargement — it is an internal matter for the Union and candidate countries. They are concerned with the consequences of these steps, including for Russia’s interests. A just and democratic solution of problems facing the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic countries can and must be one of the positive results of entry preparations. It is of fundamental importance that the Kaliningrad Region should be made an integral part of long-term and large-scale cooperation between Russia and the European Union. This is why in tandem with consultations on the consequences of EU expansion for Russia as a whole, we are now starting a separate dialogue on problems connected with the Kaliningrad Region. Our purpose is to conclude a special agreement between Russia and the EU, which will solve such crucial issues as free transit between the Kaliningrad Region and the rest of Russia, give favoured treatment to cross-border cooperation, promote fisheries, and ensure sustained power supplies. It should also include new programmes concerned with technical assistance, and preservation and expansion of commercial ties between the Region and current candidates for EU entry. Given these conditions, the Kaliningrad Region, while remaining part of the Russian Federation and its domestic market, can become a testing ground for trying out new and effective forms of cooperation with foreign countries, the European Union included. The reality is that a country with such a geopolitical position as Russia has national interests everywhere. The priority task here is to create around Russia a stable, secure and predictable situation. That would allow us to maximally concentrate efforts towards the solution of domestic socio-economic issues. To do so we pursue every foreign policy direction. One of the most important ones is, of course, Europe. <…>;2001;YES;YES;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;850;YES;he concentrates on EU defence and security which largely depend on NATO
3393;"Mr President Abdullah Gul, ladies and gentlemen, business colleagues, Anyone who might question the high level of business relations between our nations can look around this room and see the number of entrepreneurs gathered here to understand that clearly, our countries have a very good future in business. I am pleased that my visit today is culminating with this forum. Business people are pragmatic individuals thinking in practical terms and hardly responsive to mere assertions or appeals to engage in some entrepreneurial endeavours. Businesses usually believe the decisions made by authorities. I know this first-hand, because I spent a significant part of my professional life working with private businesses. I should be straightforward in stating that Russian-Turkish relations and your business ventures live through rather good times at the moment. My colleagues, who spoke earlier, have already described our accomplishments hence I will just single out several issues. First of all, we have now established a special High-Level Cooperation Council. What is the meaning of that step? This is an acknowledgement that economic relations between our nations are at a very high level. The Russian Federation has set councils like this one only if large-scale bilateral economic projects exist, or when there are long-term full-scale economic ties, therefore the fact this council has been created serves as evidence that things are going quite well. Still, the council’s goal is to further improve our economic relations, as well as political and humanitarian contacts. Thus, I hope that the council will rely on a steady trade and economic footing which in fact is already in place and has been repeatedly referred to here, I mean the [Russian-Turkish] Intergovernmental Commission headed by representatives of our governments who, as was already mentioned, have put in a lot of effort resulting in signature of many documents, some of which were the result of debates, elaborations and compromises. This is quite a customary practice though. What’s most important is that this finally happened, and today, I can once again say with satisfaction, in front of all the business community representatives in this hall, that the contracts signed open to our countries investment opportunities worth over 25 billion dollars. I shall emphasise that these are investment figures, not the trade which may vary from year to year. This is a valuable result of a hard work, and our joint success. We will continue our efforts in improving all our business ties. We will also expand our trade. Our colleagues just mentioned that last year was fairly difficult, although not catastrophic given the overall bad news coming from global markets. This year has started off rather well. Indeed, we are seeing growth in turnover evidencing that our economies are on the rise after the global crisis and are complementing one another. I hope that this year we will achieve the same figures we had in the pre-crisis year. We have also set out to meet an enormous challenge that has already been mentioned: to achieve an annual turnover of 100 billion dollars in just several years. If we are able to do this, Russia and Turkey will become major foreign trade partners. This is a level that is worthy of our nations’ potential, and I am certain that everyone present here will try to make their own input toward this 100 billion dollars goal. We are cooperating in diverse areas some of which are our power engines. Naturally, our leading area of cooperation is energy. Today, we signed some major agreements, and we will continue working in this sector in the future. Thus, I’m not even going to linger on this sector, although it is one that I care about, because I spent a significant amount of time with the Gazprom board of directors and overall, I have a good sense of the workings of our largest company, which has its own partners in Turkey. Nevertheless, I feel that investments into other fields, such as textiles, the food industry, the chemical, woodworking, and agricultural sectors, are also extremely important. Today, we signed an array of good resolutions. I would even say that they are exclusive resolutions qualifying Turkey as a very close partner of ours. They include the electronic and electro-technical industries, and all areas pertaining to high technologies. I feel that we have a lot to work on here, as our future lies here. The sectors where we already have very strong capacities should not be ignored though. I am referring first and foremost to one of the key areas in our business relations – an area of trade that will develop in any case – and that is tourism. Today, tourism received a truly important boost through an epic decision to eliminate visas for a significant number of people arriving on holiday or engaging in business talks and in joint undertakings. I think that this is a good start, and we must ultimately aim at visa-free travels. Another key area [of our cooperation] is the construction sector, which is very well-represented on the Russian market. I am certain that there are many businesspeople in this room who represent construction companies. There are many [Turkish] construction firms operating in Russia, over one hundred as I have been told. To be honest, I doubt the figure and think there are more than that as one hundred is not that many. But the fact remains that the aggregate contracts won by Turkish companies in the Russian [construction] market are worth some 30 billion dollars which is a very impressive figure indeed, and I am confident that we will be able to find new areas for jointly applying your capacities. In turn, Russian companies are also quite familiar with the Turkish market, and this is very important, because investments cannot flow only in one direction; otherwise, they would begin to dry up and there would be a decrease in interest from businesses or the government. Even though perhaps the share of Russian capital in the Turkish market is not yet as significant as we would like, but nevertheless, it is measured in billions of dollars of investments in high technologies, metallurgy, and various Turkish assets. I hope that our businesspeople, some of whom are also present here, will develop contacts with their Turkish partners more actively. I would like to say again that investments are an interpenetrating phenomenon and cannot go only one way. All of you have business partners in Russia, and you understand that it is always preferable for them to also have some prospects in your market. The truth is that our economies are growing. They are modern; they are linked to various markets and are deeply integrated into the European market. Although we are not members of the European Union per se, we interact with its member-states very actively. I think that we both have our own communication experience [with the EU] and we should think about advancing joint projects to modernise our economies. In any case, this is a goal that currently stands before the Russian economy and we will certainly move toward it. By the way, there are some interesting ideas about promoting high-tech projects on the Turkish market, particularly projects related to creating wireless broadband access to the internet using WiMAX and LTE technologies. But this is just one example; I am simply bringing it up because this is a technology of the future and because I personally find it interesting. We do have some problems though, and we must discuss them as well. The goal of a partnership is not to gloss over the existing situation and claim that we are absolutely exclusive business partners, that everything is fine, and that we do not foresee any problems in the future. Problems do exist – both on the Russian side and the Turkish side. Hence the goal of our governments, intergovernmental commissions, and ultimately presidents, is to resolve thsse problems. Several of these problems were mentioned today and I see them as affecting a lot of areas. They are not just Russian problems, they are also Turkish problems to certain degree and they include customs barriers, as well as reliance on reserve currencies that occasionally dip – such as when the dollar or the euro is not doing so well. We absolutely need to think about truly, cardinally expanding the use of our national currencies. Some states are already doing this very well; everyone knows about China’s experience. We could definitely set things up so that a significant share of our turnover makes use of rubles or liras. There are problems related to banking operations and services. It is imperative to establish a joint bank, or even multiple joint banks, because when we have 40 to 100 billion dollars in turnover, this requires special banking instruments. I think that we need to stimulate these kinds of decisions. There are also issues regarding quotas, logistics centres, and sea port capacities. I hope that we will have a lot fewer issues with regard to visas following our new resolutions. Finally, there are matters concerning authorities and judicial decisions from both sides. Today, we discussed these subjects. Thus, there is still a significant amount of work to be done by authorities, governments, and courts. It is impossible to promote such major projects and such serious relations without participation by the governments – and there can be no doubt that our relations are very serious. I would like to sincerely congratulate you as respected representatives of our business communities on the breakthrough in trade and economic relations that we witnessed today during the President of the Russian Federation’s official visit to Turkey. I wish you all success in your business affairs.";2010;YES;YES;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;1825;NO;
6666;Ms Le Pen, this is not your first time in Moscow, and I am pleased to welcome you here. I am aware that you came at the invitation of the State Duma – the parliament of the Russian Federation. We value highly our relations with France and try to maintain good relations with incumbent government and the opposition. I am, of course, aware of the ongoing election campaign in France. In no case do we want to influence the events as they unfold, but we reserve the right to communicate with all representatives of all political forces in France, just like our partners in Europe and the United States are doing.  Of course, it would be very interesting to exchange opinions with you on our bilateral relations and the situation in Europe. I know that you represent a European political force that is growing quickly.  I am very pleased to see you. Marine Le Pen (retranslated): Thank you, Mr President. As you know, I have long been urging the restoration of cultural, economic and strategic ties between Russia and France, which is especially important now when we face a serious terrorist threat. The fight against terrorism can only be truly effective if the largest nations stand side by side and join forces. Russia is fighting in Syria. France has contributed by waging Operation Barkhane in Chad and by fighting terrorism in Mali. I believe that our countries are taking a very active part in this struggle, including by providing assistance to the countries that had to fight the rise of terrorism in the past and are still fighting this threat. Mr President, you know that terrorist blows have been delivered to France. Yesterday terrorists delivered a terrible blow with many casualties. They continue their attacks every day, using new forms of terrorism, including so-called economy-class terrorism, when the blows are delivered by individuals some of whom enter our countries together with migrants to strike at the population on orders from terrorist organisations, such as ISIS. I believe that in this situation we must do everything in our power to create conditions for an effective exchange of intelligence information in order to protect our nations from the threat that has hit France and has recently delivered a blow to our British friends. I would like to say that I see it as a big problem that Russian MPs cannot meet with their colleagues from the EU countries. I believe that meetings between representatives of our democratic forces can help all of us find an effective solution to the ongoing terrorist crisis, which, apart from the military aspect, has many other components, as I could see during a meeting with President of Chad Idriss Deby. As we have said at the meeting with the State Duma Speaker, I believe that all countries should also think about human trafficking, that is trade in people for purposes of financing terrorism. As you know, there have been many terrorist attacks in Russia. France, Belgium, the United States and many other countries have also suffered. Unfortunately, the erosion of traditional values in many Middle Eastern countries has intensified violence and migration flows. Tragic events are taking place in Syria and in Iraq’s Mosul, where hundreds of thousands of refugees were forced to flee from their homes. I fully agree with you that we can effectively fight terrorism only by pooling our efforts. Today, so soon after the tragedy in London, a tragic event happened in Chechnya in the North Caucasus, where terrorists attacked a National Guard unit. We all live in difficult conditions. We must open our eyes to this threat and join forces to fight terrorism. Marine Le Pen (retranslated): Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that in addition to solidarity and joint actions, which we definitely need, such countries as Russia should consider ways to promote the development of African countries, in particular, in Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. The African countries that are fighting terrorism say this struggle requires significant financial resources. As a result, they have to reduce spending on healthcare, education and agriculture.  Besides, many young people face the temptation of escaping economic problems by joining armed terrorist groups. In other words, I believe that we need a truly global strategy that will bring together all the countries that want to preserve or restore security around the world.   In my opinion, this strategy should include attention to the economic development of the countries that have become the object of the terrorist threat and have to defend themselves against it.  I fully agree with you. You are quite right. <…>;2017;YES;YES;NO;Regex-No / LLM-Yes;862;NO;
5427;"Good afternoon, please, go ahead. Regarding the summit overall, I think it was a big success. We reviewed what has been achieved so far in the economy, in coordinating our positions on the international stage, and discussed at the meeting in narrow format our assessments of current events and the threats that we see and that we must respond to in timely and competent fashion, above all the Afghanistan problem. I will not go into detail now, but you probably all saw it for yourselves anyway, and it is all reflected in the documents. We discussed other troubled parts of the world too, North Africa, Iraq of course, and other countries. Of course we also discussed the situation in Ukraine. I briefed my colleagues on what is happening there. Our common position (and I mean precisely our common position, as we share practically the same views and approach regarding this issue) is reflected in the relevant summit document. You can take a look at it for yourselves. It sets out everything in detail. I would not say that Ukraine was discussed as a separate issue of its own, rather it was examined as one of the issues we face today. I had bilateral meetings with nearly all of my colleagues. I had very constructive meetings with the presidents of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and with the various participants and members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, including President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping. We have highly developed bilateral relations with each of these countries. China, as you know, is our biggest trade and economic partner and our bilateral trade will reach a figure of nearly $90 billion this year. China is our biggest partner among individual countries. We also discussed our plans to enlarge the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. You saw that we adopted documents today relating to procedures for accession of new member countries to the organisation. Russia took over the organisation’s presidency for the coming year. We plan to hold a summit in Ufa next year. Over this time, we plan to hold more than 100 events of various types and level, economic and humanitarian. The summit will of course be the concluding event and will take place in July next year. Or course we will also work on the question of accepting new members into the organisation. India and Pakistan have both expressed the desire to join the organisation. We will work with all of our partners and colleagues and with all participants in the organisation. Let’s see what results we can achieve by July next year. Overall, our delegation sees this summit as having been very productive and a big success. We held this first ever trilateral meeting at Mongolia’s initiative. Excuse me for not mentioning this before. We agreed that we will continue meeting in this format. Russia proposed that we meet in trilateral format on the sidelines of SCO summits, all the more so as Mongolia is an observer country in the SCO and regularly attends the summits. We have plenty to discuss of course in this trilateral format. Our natural geographical proximity and Mongolia’s geographical location between its two biggest trade and economic partners – China on one side and Russia on the other – can encourage us into carrying out many joint projects, especially in infrastructure and the energy sector. These are all things that we discussed.  Again, acting on Mongolia’s proposal, we also agreed that we will perhaps raise the level of our regularly functioning political instrument. The three countries’ representatives meet regularly at the level of ministerial department heads. We agreed to raise this level to that of say deputy minister or perhaps even minister. We have an immense amount of work to do with our Chinese partners too. This includes work in the energy sector, machine building, aircraft manufacturing, and military technical cooperation. We went over our entire bilateral agenda, highlighted some things in particular, and agreed on what needs to be pushed through at the political level. Overall, we are happy at the way our relations with China are developing. Russia’s position on sanctions is well-known. We have long since realised that sanctions as a foreign policy instrument are not very effective and almost never produce the hoped-for results, even when used against small countries, let alone against a country like Russia. Of course, imposing sanctions always causes some damage, including for those who impose them. The sanctions against Russia will be no exception. We know the losses that European business and US business too will face and the damage done to trade relations as a result of the measures Russia has taken in response, but as we say in such cases, we have been left with no choice.  As for the latest round of sanctions, the use of this mechanism looks somewhat strange, even in a generally strange situation. I say this because, as you know, I had a telephone conversation with President of Ukraine [Petro] Poroshenko recently, and following on from that conversation I proposed an action plan for setting the conflict on track towards a peaceful settlement.  I even said at that moment in Ulan Bator, talking about these plans, that President Poroshenko and I were generally in agreement in our positions. Building on that conversation, I put forward a seven-point plan, which, as we saw, essentially became the base of the peace agreements signed at the contact group’s meeting in Minsk. We are pleased to see that the process did begin and that hostilities have stopped, the militia have ceased hostilities and the Ukrainian army, to give the Ukrainian President his due, has also taken the required steps under the agreements. They have pulled back, in some places at least, and have pulled back their artillery and multiple launch rocket systems to a distance from where they cannot fire on populated areas. The peace process has begun and so have the first contacts, and I think that the possibility has emerged that this process might produce a political settlement, even if just a temporary one for now. This is definitely a positive shift in the situation that has unfolded in southeast Ukraine. But I cannot fathom what these latest sanctions are actually about. Perhaps it is not to someone’s liking that the process has taken a peaceful turn? I have already said many times that our Western partners pushed things towards an anti-constitutional coup in Kiev, and then supported the military operations in southeast Ukraine, and now, just when the situation has taken a turn towards a peaceful settlement, they are taking steps that practically aim to disrupt this peace process. Why are they doing this?  I can’t help but think the seditious thought that no one actually cares about Ukraine itself. They are just using Ukraine as an instrument to shake up international relations. Ukraine is being used as an instrument and has been made hostage to the desire of some players on the international stage to revive NATO say, not so much even as a military organisation, but as a key instrument in US foreign policy, in order for the US to consolidate its satellites and scare them with a threat from abroad. But if this is the case, this is a real shame because it means that Ukraine has essentially become hostage to another’s interests. I do not see anything good in this practice.  As for our retaliatory measures, the Government is considering this. But if they are applied, then they will only be applied with the goal of creating better conditions for us. I feel there are certainly downsides to what was done to limit food imports for us as well, but they are minimal. There are far more positives for stimulating the development of our own agriculture, freeing the market from Western manufacturers that have thoroughly assimilated in our market, and meanwhile, they receive much more support and subsidies at a much higher volume than our agricultural producers. Some people know, and others don’t, that subsidies per hectare of cultivated lands in the European Union are six times greater – I want to stress this – than in the Russian Federation. So the competition here was not very fair. But if the Government comes up with an idea that will help us somehow resolve our internal problems, then I suppose we should agree with it. But we will not do anything to harm ourselves. This concerns our response to sanctions. As for the lists, I welcome this resolution by the European Union. The less our officials and heads of major companies go abroad and work on pressing matters instead, the better. The same is true of State Duma deputies, who need to communicate more frequently with their voters, rather than tanning somewhere at foreign resorts. Nevertheless, some questions arise; there are some names there that seem rather strange. I do not recall, I think it was one of the deputies, I think it was Babakov. And then the wording there… Yes, for assets in Ukraine and in Crimea. But Ukraine’s current leadership also has many assets in Ukraine and in Crimea. Apparently, if you follow this logic further, they themselves need to be included in the sanctions list. Moreover, it included the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Republic. Our Western and Ukrainian partners insisted that officials from the self-proclaimed republics participate in the peace negotiation process. They came to us requesting that we use our influence to encourage them to participate. We tried to do this. The prime minister is participating in this work and was accepted as a participant in the negotiations. But then they included him on the sanctions list. What is this, another attempt to somehow disrupt this peace process? Or what? What is this? I would not want to think so. But there is certainly no logic in this whatsoever. And overall, you know, I am against these types of things – tit for tat, if they are not letting somebody in then we are not letting somebody in. We invite them to our nation; let them come and work. We are not going to refuse anyone. It is not even our choice. We will not follow that path. But if somebody does not want to work with us, there will always be alternatives. You apparently got a little distracted, because I stated that certain aspects of this are undoubtedly negative. But if we look at the problem comprehensively, there are more positives than negatives. Listen. I am not getting involved in such technical work at this phase. It is true that the Cabinet is currently thinking this over, preparing certain suggestions. If my colleagues in the Cabinet come to the conclusion that a specific set of steps correspond to the interests of our economy, then we will do it. And if it’s just about showing off how tough we are, just to snap back and then to suffer damage as a result of that, we will not do it. Ultimately, I wanted to convey our approach; as for the concrete steps that will be taken, if they are taken at all, we will see. Let the Cabinet think about it and make suggestions. Thank you very much.";2014;NO;YES;YES;Regex-Yes / LLM-No;2120;YES;
2498;The latest summit of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) has just ended. Naturally enough, perhaps most important of all today was the fact that this summit took place against a backdrop of the far from simple international situation that has emerged following the recent events in the Caucasus region. I want to say straight away that one of this summit’s most important outcomes is that we have reached a consolidated position on this issue. Our partners in the CSTO have given a clearly negative assessment of Georgia’s action, Georgia’s aggression against South Ossetia, voiced their support for Russia’s active role and spoken in favour of solid security guarantees for South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The CSTO member states have called for an assessment of the situation free from double standards.  We had a very productive discussion at our meeting in narrow format, an absolutely honest open and direct discussion, as a result of which we have been able to demonstrate a new level of internal political coordination within the CSTO.  Russia has always supported diplomatic solutions to disputes, but if necessary we will take firm action in defending our interests – this is the main lesson we have learned from these events – in compliance with international law, of course.  I want to make it clear that we did not choose confrontation. This says it all.  Now, on the recognition of South Ossetia’s and Abkhazia’s independence, of course our partners in the CSTO will each decide for themselves what line to take, in accordance with the principles and provisions of international law and in consideration of their own national interests too, of course. Russia considers this absolutely correct.  We discussed many other important questions too. We reviewed the results of our work to maintain peace and stability in the CSTO’s zone of responsibility, and we continued work on bolstering the organisation’s military component and building up its functional capabilities. We also set directions for future work, taking into consideration the security threats we face today.  The Declaration adopted today sets out our assessments and approaches regarding the most relevant international issues and confirms our common desire to build cooperation as allies on all issues of mutual interest.  We set out priorities for the organisation’s work over the second half of this year and the first half of next year. These priorities include important new steps to deepen military coalition building. We have, for example, made changes to the CSTO decision of May 25, 2001, on collective rapid reaction forces in the Central Asia collective security region and approved the regulation on procedures for drafting financing and implementing CSTO targeted inter-governmental programmes. These steps aim to give our military-technical cooperation greater substance and introduce modern and promising new working methods, which is something very important today.  We have also signed documents in the areas of counter-terrorism and preventing drugs trafficking. These are the collective action plan on forming a CSTO information security system, and a council decision, only just adopted, on additional measures to bolster anti-narcotics work within the CSTO.  Once again, I would like to say that the summit’s results confirm our common commitment to continue coordinated work to produce concrete results. The CSTO remains a guarantor of our countries’ territorial integrity and sovereignty, and non-intervention in their internal affairs.  I would like to thank separately all of my colleagues for their work together. We have indeed had a very substantial and productive discussion, a serious discussion that has taken into consideration the recent events. And I want to express my sincere wishes of success to Armenia’s representative, Serzh Azatovich [Sargsyan], who has taken over the presidency now.  Thank you. As I just said, the heads of state, have also expressed their common position on this issue. And so as not to make unsubstantiated claims, I will just read out some of the provisions of the Declaration that we just adopted. What does it say? ” The CSTO member states are deeply concerned over Georgia’s attempt to resolve the conflict in South Ossetia by force, an act that has caused numerous victims among civilians and peacekeepers, as well as severe humanitarian consequences”. Further. ”CSTO member states are concerned about the growing military capabilities and escalating tensions in the Caucasus region and call on all countries to make a balanced and objective assessment of events in the Caucasus, free of double standard, and not to undertake any action that could provoke an escalation in the situation. Members of the Organisation have consistently advocated the primacy of the rule of international law in international relations and the maintenance of peace and security, and welcome the peace settlement principles drawn up by the President of Russia and the President of France, as well as call on the parties to observe the rigorous implementation of these principles in order to prevent further attempts to resolve the conflict using force as well as to ensure stability in the region. Member states support Russia’s active role in facilitating peace and cooperation in the region and are in favour of lasting security for South Ossetia and Abkhazia. CSTO member states express the need for continued cooperation in re-establishing an effective mechanism for control over the various weapons ”. For obvious reasons, the Declaration is a long one and not only devoted to developments in the Caucasus: there are many very important and significant points concerning the situation in Europe, the proliferation of medium- and short-range ground-based missiles, strengthening the role of the United Nations, as well as the situation in several conflict zones, the situation in Afghanistan, the situation around Iran, the prospects of establishing relations between the CSTO and NATO in a number of issues, and support for the initiatives of the Russian Federation relating to a treaty on European security. Thus, on the basis of this Declaration you can judge the real, tangible intentions CSTO member states. May I first say two words? I believe that the Organisation’s members are also great powers and this is why the Organisation has such a responsibility. Indeed, our organisation is young but very promising. And in order to raise its profile, in addition to concerted actions — especially in times of crisis, like that in the Caucasus — we need to step up cooperation on all fronts. With regards to ensuring regional and interregional security, preventing emergency situations, engaging in disaster management and, last but not least, based on the nature of the organisation, its military component. If the organisation develops in this direction, it will be a strong organisation, which really helps ensure the national security of all States Parties. Without a certain rigidity in the implementation of decisions, without strengthening its military component, the organisation cannot grow, and we are now talking about this with my colleagues. It is quite obvious. The organisation has rights and responsibilities, including in matters of self-defence, the elimination of the consequences of armed conflicts, attacks on member countries, and we believe that all these items of its founding Treaty should be strictly enforced. Expanding our potential in these areas would indicate that the organisation is getting stronger and becoming one of the most authoritative organisations in this sphere. A few conclusions. First, we need to conduct ourselves decently, to abide by international law, respect the agreements that have been reached, including with respect to peacekeeping. If someone does not do so, they will face harsh consequences. This is probably one of the most significant conclusions that should be drawn on the basis of the crisis in the Caucasus. No one is allowed to kill people, destroy peacekeepers — who are there under international mandate — with impunity. The implications will be very serious. Another conclusion. Following such conflicts, we all must think about what additional mechanisms must be used to prevent them in the future. What are these mechanisms? Of course they include those derived from our Treaty, the CSTO. There is a need for a coherent foreign policy in this regard. What Serzh Azatovich just said is absolutely accurate. We also need to strengthen the military component so that those who wish to arm themselves still have the appropriate incentives to opt for more reasonable solutions. We would be extremely reluctant for the incorrect conclusions to be made from this conflict in the Caucasus. We would not like Georgia, which acted as aggressor, to continue to arm and to do so uncontrollably, with unclear objectives and completely unforeseeable consequences. It seems to me that this is a lesson for the entire international community, including for those who take decisions about additional funding and military-technical cooperation with Georgia. There is another conclusion. After what happened, it is clear that the security architecture that existed prior to 8 August 2008 has proved its weakness. The entire international community must reflect on the creation of new architecture, which would be based on the principles of international cooperation, strict compliance with international law, avoiding arbitrary interpretation of the law and conflict prevention. This order should be based on multipolarity and the avoidance of domination by any state which considers it possible to assume the role of establishing a single world order. I have already spoken about this. I believe that such a system has absolutely no perspective and is even dangerous. Unfortunately, such a system is not able to ensure security, as was proven by events surrounding South Ossetia. These are probably the main lessons that we all need to draw from what happened.

541;"It is a planned visit. We agreed with Chairman Jiang Zemin that we would regularly exchange such visits: the Chinese leader would come to Russia and the Russian leader to China. But this is a very special visit. As you have rightly said it is taking place shortly after the 16th Congress of the Communist Party of China. It is a key event not only in your country. Considering the growing economic potential and growing influence and importance of China in world affairs, the Congress was a major international event. We all understand why it has attracted such attention. A change of generations is taking place in the top state and political leadership of China. And it is of course important for all your partners to know how China will build its relations, not only with its neighbours, but with other states. To us, it is an issue of paramount importance because China is one of our partners in world affairs, and we have many serious plans in the bilateral field. Besides, we are neighbours and there are many issues connected with our interaction because of that factor. I have a scheduled meeting with Chairman Jiang Zemin with whom I have formed a very good personal relationship. A year ago I became acquainted with the new General Secretary of the Party Central Committee, Comrade Hu Jintao when he was in Moscow on a working visit. We had a chance to meet personally and discuss some bilateral and international problems. You know that recently we signed a Treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighbourly Relations and Cooperation with the People’s Republic of China. And I must say that it was mainly on the initiative of the Chairman of the PRC. We appreciate it and we believe that this is undoubtedly a historic event in our bilateral relations. So we have to synchronise our efforts on how the tasks set by the signing of the treaty are being fulfilled. There are many issues to be discussed in the economic, energy, and military-technical fields. We have things to discuss because we have to co-ordinate our actions on the world scene. I must tell you that coordinated global actions of the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation are a substantial factor in dealing with a number of major world problems. China has impressive plans for development. I must say that the pace of the Chinese economy’s development and the competent way in which China goes about it, especially in recent years, attract special attention to the experience of the PRC. So we will focus attention on interaction in the economic sphere. There are many things to discuss here. I have already referred to energy projects. The Chinese economy is expanding and so is its energy consumption. China has limited resources, but Russia has ample. We are talking about long-term contracts which are of interest both to Russia and to the People’s Republic of China. I have already mentioned the need to coordinate our actions in the world, but I must single out some priorities. China is a nuclear power and our interaction with the People’s Republic of China in ensuring world stability and nuclear non-proliferation – non-proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery – is a substantial element of our cooperation and a substantial factor in world politics. So it is a separate package of problems that we will discuss. Then there are the so-called modern challenges and threats. Among the main threats, of course, is international terrorism. International terrorists threaten many countries, and this worries both the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation. I must say that even before the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York on September 11, 2001 China and Russia adopted documents within the framework of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation warning the world about that growing threat. Unfortunately, not everyone listened to us at the time. But I think we will pay significant attention to this issue during the course of the visit. Of course, we are very interested in the situation in the Asia-Pacific Region. We will work on the agreements reached within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. We have put in place special mechanisms of interaction with the centre in Bishkek and we agreed on exchanging information in a number of sensitive areas. That too will be the focus of our attention. It is no secret that since the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation was established it has been growing and its influence and the attention it commands on the part of world powers have also been growing. This is not accidental because its zone of interests includes not only the Central Asian region, which is very important, but the adjacent regions as well. And we know that unfortunately, many of the terrorists’ targets are located in these regions. Examples are not hard to find. We are aware of the tragedies that happened in the Philippines, Indonesia and some other countries in the region. We are aware of the problems that China encounters. We know that it too is eyed by international terrorists. This cannot but worry us. And we must pool our efforts in order to effectively combat that threat. Naturally, the zone of our interaction within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, initially established only to deal with border issues between neighbours, expanded. We saw that the potential of our cooperation is much broader and we will spread it to the economic sphere and to the fight against terrorism. As I said, we have created certain mechanisms for joint work: we set up a centre in Bishkek and we agreed on how to deepen our cooperation within the framework of that organisation and on a bilateral basis, how not to confine it to cooperation between political leaders and to expand it to involve the secret services and law enforcement bodies. First of all, I would like to thank the people of China, on whose behalf the PRC leaders supported their friends in Russia during the difficult and tragic days when hostages were taken in Moscow. They showed their solidarity with us and, I repeat, they acted on behalf of the Chinese people. I would like to cordially thank all the people of China. Second, the terrorists made miscalculations. They hoped to split Russian society, but that did not happen. On the contrary, they were faced with a strong and united resistance. Their actions proved to be counterproductive: they further consolidated Russian society and gave it new insights into the essence of the ongoing processes. And these processes essentially stem from the fact that international terrorism, under the cover of false slogans of fighting for the independence of Chechnya, is actually pursuing goals that have nothing to do with the interests of the Chechen people. In effect, it is part of a global terrorist network, and their aims are different: to separate the North Caucasus from Russia and then continue on. The awareness that these were the true intentions came not only to the majority of Russian citizens, but to the people who live in Chechnya. The processes of restoring the political, economic and social spheres received a new impetus there. After the attack, authoritative public and religious leaders in the Chechen Republic raised the issue of speeding up the formation of legitimate bodies of power and adopting the Constitution of Chechnya. We are ready to help them. I think it is the “threat” of restoring normal life in Chechnya that prompted the terrorist attack. It was aimed at disrupting the peace process. The aim was not achieved. As I have said, on the contrary, it will speed up the process of consolidating the whole Russian society and the solution of political problems in Chechnya. There is only one way: the Chechen people must be given a chance to adopt their own constitution and form legitimate government bodies that ordinary Chechen citizens will trust and with which they will jointly work to restore peace in Chechnya. We are going to follow that path. And all those who carry weapons, those who do not want to embark on peaceful life, will be held accountable or eliminated. Judging from the mood during the meeting with the representatives of the Chechen Republic and Chechen public figures, they expect to complete the preparatory process within several months. In other words, we can look forward to the referendum on a constitution by the spring of next year. You know, there are no large-scale military operations there. There are sporadic terrorist acts and attempts to disrupt the peace process. But the terrorists are unlikely to succeed. I think that the process of peaceful transformations in Chechnya is irreversible. Of course, what is needed to attract investments and create a favourable investment climate is stability: political and economic stability, predictable actions of the government at all levels, lack of red tape in decision making, a good administrative environment and an efficient court system. We are going to proceed in all these areas. You, perhaps, know that we recently passed a package of laws strengthening the judiciary system. We will continue to work to liberalise the tax system and currency legislation. We will seek to relieve the tax burden and of course we hope that the key conditions I mentioned earlier will be ensured. We do not intend to be overly optimistic, but we believe it would be wrong to belittle the importance of our interaction with the CIS countries. Not only because we all come from the former Soviet Union, but also we are linked by a vast number of invisible threads in the spheres of the economy, culture, language and common history. Suffice it to say that more than 20 million Russians live in the CIS countries, across the border from the Russian Federation. More than 20 million people. That is a large number for us. But it is equally important that the overwhelming majority of people in the CIS consider Russian to be their second native tongue. We have no language barriers. That and the fact that we are still heavily interdependent in the economic sphere make the strengthening of interaction with the CIS countries the main priority of the Russian foreign policy. In that respect no changes in the world can influence this priority in Russian foreign policy. Of course, the world community is developing. We assume that the only thing that does not change is our respect for the sovereignty of these countries and their domestic and foreign policy. But our priorities remain unchanged. I met the Belarusian President today, and he didn’t tell me about it. Our position is that in order to meet the modern threats – and the main threats today, in my opinion, are international terrorism and nuclear weapons proliferation – one does not need to expand the NATO military-political bloc. The expansion of the bloc does not address the main tasks facing mankind today. But on the other hand, every country has the right to determine its foreign policy priorities, as I said answering your previous question. We will not regard it as a tragedy. Each country has every right to join any organisation as a sovereign state. For our part we are also expanding our cooperation with NATO. You know that a NATO-Russia Council has been set up. We are satisfied with the way our cooperation is developing. Indeed, we do not rule out that we can further expand our cooperation with that organisation. But only if NATO itself – as the heads of its leading member states say – gradually transforms itself and adapts to the new tasks and gears itself up to react to the new threats and if the activities of the organisation meet the national interests of Russia. However, to ensure the security of Russia, I am sure that full membership in NATO is not necessary. You think it is the easiest question? I think it is the trickiest question. I may be mistaken, but I think there is a Chinese proverb that says: “May God spare you living in the times of change.” Do you have such a proverb? We have been living through change for 17 years, since 1985. People want stability. They don’t want stagnation because it breeds boredom and apathy, but they want stability in the positive sense of the word. They want to see light at the end of the tunnel; they want to live better; they want their children to have the prospect of a better life. You know, I have never engaged in political populism, I never make promises that cannot be kept. I set myself and the Government only realistic tasks. I admit that things do not always work out the way we want and we cannot always solve the issues we would like to solve to the fullest extent. But still gradually, very slowly, real incomes are growing, although there are still instances when the payment of wages or pensions is delayed, but it is no longer a large-scale phenomenon as it was, say, a couple of years ago. On the contrary, the pensions are growing little by little and the wages of public sector employees and the salaries of servicemen are also growing. I think everybody in Russia would agree with me that we want to live in peace and friendship with everyone, not only with our neighbours, but with all the countries in the world, but we expect that our partners will respect the national interests of Russia. I think the commitment to move in that direction is met with a positive response among many Russian citizens, at least for now. I think however, it would be an unpardonable mistake on my part and on the part of my colleagues if we look at the opinion polls and decide that we have it made and that nothing else needs to be done. On the contrary, I for one believe that if the people trust us it means they expect results that would make a difference in their standard of living, the level of their wellbeing – make a huge difference. Only then would we have good reason to say that we are coping with the tasks we have set ourselves. We have managed to preserve economic growth. This year we have set the target growth at 3.5%. It looks as if we may achieve a 4% growth, perhaps a little more. That is not so bad. Having said that, I know that the Congress of the Communist Party of China set a target of 7% annual growth. If we managed to achieve a 7–8% annual growth I think we could say that we are doing a satisfactory job. My hobbies are known: I play sports, although not Chinese ones. But I must say that members of my family, my daughters for example, are into wushu, and one daughter has started learning Chinese. So, we pay great attention to the Chinese language, Chinese culture, Chinese literature and history. I hope that considering our closeness, the historical roots of our interaction, and most importantly, the positive development of our relations, Russian interest in the People’s Republic of China will constantly grow. I like what I do and I enjoy doing it. I haven’t read a single one of them. I am being quite frank with you, I haven’t read a single book about myself because I am sure that I know a lot more about myself than those who write about me. Thank you very much.";2002;NO;YES;YES;Regex-Yes / LLM-No;2895;YES;
4175;Mr Rogozin, I see that you have already got to grips with your new job. This is good. Let’s talk about the main tasks now, above all, implementation of the 2012–2014 defence procurement orders. The situation last year was not the best, to be honest. I called together the deputy prime minister responsible for the area and the defence minister in order to discuss the prospects ahead. I hope that this year will bring substantially better results. What do I want to see exactly this year? Under the current rules, the deadline for placing orders with the common supplier, as I understand it, is March 1 this year, and the deadline for tenders and bids is April 15. I ask you to keep to these deadlines and monitor the instructions’ implementation. We cannot allow any delays for the simple reason that the defence industry companies will not get any money, and then, as always happens, everything will get shifted back to the end of the year with the risk that state procurement orders will go unfulfilled. So, monitor the situation and report to me personally.  The second issue is developing the defence industry itself. There are various processes at work in the sector, and I would not present everything as all doom and gloom, but nor is the picture all rosy either. There are modern companies producing decent products, and there are also companies that, sadly, need to upgrade their technology. Our goal is to have a strong and modern defence industry that develops new goods and weapons that will be in demand both at home and on markets abroad. The defence industry’s technological modernisation is therefore a top priority. We need to ensure quality control of the industry’s goods too, so as to avoid conflicts between the companies and the Defence Ministry. We don’t want situations when the companies say, “Buy all of our goods, because everything we make is good quality,” and the Defence Ministry says, “They are worthless compared to the NATO models.” These are therefore the two key tasks for the defence industry today. Finally, I am ready to hear your proposals on developing and improving the industry’s organisation and management, including with regard to the place, role, and importance of Rosoboronzakaz, Rosoboronpostavka and other organisations involved in the sector’s work. You have the floor. The new force. Good. As far as the plants go, as you said, you often end up having to turn to hands-on management. I also had to put in some effort to push this idea through. Unfortunately, for various bureaucratic reasons, this whole process has been delayed. It is good that construction work is actually beginning now. I hope that we will soon see these plants’ goods, because as you and our consumers know, these are products for which there is demand at home and abroad. We need to ensure full and proper funding for this production because the scheme that was proposed was a compromise option. If it works, so much the better, but if any problems come up, let me know so that we can make the necessary changes. A number of former government officials took an obstructive line when we were implementing this system, and we need to bring order to the situation now. I hope that you will do this. That’s agreed then. <…>;2012;NO;NO;YES;Regex-Yes / LLM-No;643;YES;
36;My position is that our country should be a strong, powerful state, a capable and effective state, in which both its citizens and all those who want to cooperate with Russia could feel comfortable and protected, could always feel in their own shoes – if you allow the expression – psychologically and morally, and well off. But this has nothing to do with aggression. If we again and again go back to the terminology of the Cold War we are never going to discard attitudes and problems that humanity had to grapple with a mere 15–20 years ago. We in Russia have to a large extent rid ourselves of what is related to the Cold War. Regrettably, it appears that our partners in the West are all too often still in the grip of old notions and tend to picture Russia as a potential aggressor. That is a completely wrong conception of our country. It gets in the way of developing normal relations in Europe and in the world. Outside the framework of this interview we talked about sports a little. You know that I have been into sports since I was a kid, I like sports. We have always been taught that any partner, any opponent should be treated with respect. That means that in some ways he may be stronger than you, so I am not inclined to believe that I am assured of victory, that I have it in my hand, that the campaign is over. I don't think I have a right to consider myself a winner. Gennady Zyuganov and his Communist party enjoy substantial social support. When I think about Chechnya my first thoughts are that the Chechen people have fallen victim to international extremism. I think that ordinary people in Chechnya suffer because of the policies conducted by Russia over the past few years. Let's face it: Chechnya enjoyed de-facto – and I want to stress that – de-facto complete independence since 1996. Regrettably, no coherent state structure ever came into being in Chechnya. And then extremist forces took advantage of that vacuum, they broke up the territory of the Chechen Republic into a maze of small separate entities, each headed by a warlord, a so-called field commander – outside the framework of any constitution, any legal foundation. So what we got was like a mini-Afghanistan. The warlords became the real masters of these tiny entities within a small and, undoubtedly, a proud nation. And that precipitated the tragedy with which we are confronted today. Those extremist forces began reclaiming this territory, as it were. Arms were supplied to them from outside the country, money began to flow, mercenaries began to arrive. It should also be said that in these few years 220,000 ethnic Russians left the republic – just think of that – and about 550,000–600,000 Chechens. They all voted with their feet, they all fled from that regime. Last summer there was a completely unprovoked attack on the republic of Dagestan, which borders on Chechnya. The bandits then blew up several residential blocks in Moscow, Volgodonsk and other cities of the Russian Federation. As a symbol of their revenge they killed almost 1,500 people in those blasts. And from that moment on it became crystal clear to us that unless we deliver a blow at the very lair of terrorism, at the bases situated in the Chechen Republic, we would never be able to rid ourselves of this scourge, this gangrene. With their actions the terrorists forced us to pursue this option – and I just don't think they expected us to act as resolutely as we did.  I would like to give you an extended answer to this question. There are terrorists who kidnap innocent people by the hundred and keep them in cellars, torture and execute them. I stress, we are talking about perfectly innocent people, kidnapped not for political reasons, but for purely criminal commercial gain. And I know that citizens of your country have also fallen victim to those criminals. Are these cutthroats any better than Nazi criminals? We are liberating the people of Chechnya from this scourge, and we feel obliged to do that in the name of the Chechen people and other peoples of the Russian Federation. We have stressed again and again that all our actions are geared to minimising those casualties. And, mind you, there have been no large numbers of casualties among civilians. We understand that one of the forms of struggle is information warfare. The video footage you mentioned, which had been shown to the world by German television, has now been refuted by our own media. Izvestia newspaper has carried information coming straight from the man who really shot those sequences and he accused his German colleague of falsification. In fact, the German journalist simply bought the tape off our cameraman and what it shows is the burial of rebels killed in action.  That was then presented to the international public as evidence of torture and execution of prisoners. Which had nothing to do with reality. This is nothing more and nothing less than a frontline of information warfare, of confrontation. I repeat, this is a complete lie and falsification.  We have no need to kill civilians. It is a fact that our troops have been taking the biggest cities and towns in Chechnya with the help of Chechen people, with direct support from the people of Chechnya, without a single shot. So what is the sense in brutalising civilians? On the contrary, we are counting on their support and are receiving it. Why would we aggravate the civilians?  We want to extend a helping hand to the people of Chechnya so that peace finally comes to the Chechen land. That is unthinkable without cooperation with the Chechens themselves. So if there are facts of cruelty, of crimes against peaceful citizens of Chechnya – then that goes against the aims set by the Russian political leadership and me personally. Of course, if there are people who violate laws, they will try to conceal that. But there are instruments to reveal such facts and find out the truth, there are people who work to achieve the goals that I personally set forth. Naturally, all such facts will be scrupulously investigated. Only last night in one of the mountainous areas, where fairly large formations of militants were concentrated, our troops managed to inflict several powerful blows. And I think that from this moment on organised resistance is virtually impossible. Our task is to defeat those international criminals, who rely on support from extremist forces in Afghanistan and other countries in this region and to offer the people of Chechnya and its neighbours a chance to decide on their republics' future through political means. I think in the nearest future the military phase of the operation will have been completed. It will take some time to restore the social sphere, schools, hospitals, homes for the elderly, to reinstate the supplies, to reinstate the basic bodies of government, municipal bodies. That will take some time, but that won't be connected with any kind of military action. We have no aim of cornering the Chechen people, chasing them into a cave. We don't want them to develop a syndrome of a defeated nation. The people should understand that they are not a defeated people. They are a liberated people – liberated from outside pressure.  I agree, of course. And that is exactly what we've been doing. We have set in place a significantly simplified procedure of accrediting foreign journalists in Chechnya and the Caucasus as a whole. I have already mentioned that the authorities have a vested interest in obtaining objective information. It is not only the public that is interested in receiving objective information, we are, too. This is an instrument we would gladly use. The only thing that causes our concern is security considerations. Russia is part of the European culture. And I cannot imagine my own country in isolation from Europe and what we often call the civilised world. So it is hard for me to visualise NATO as an enemy. I think even posing the question this way will not do any good to Russia or the world. The very question is capable of causing damage. Russia strives for equitable and candid relations with its partners. The main problem here lies in attempts to discard previously agreed common decision-making instruments –primarily as regards international security. We are open to equitable cooperation, to partnership.  We believe we can talk about more profound integration with NATO but only if Russia is regarded as an equal partner. You are aware we have been constantly voicing our opposition to NATO's eastward enlargement.  I don't see why not. I would not rule out such a possibility, but I repeat – if and when Russia's views are taken into account as those of an equal partner. I want to stress this again and again. The situation that was laid down in the founding principles of the United Nations took into account realities that took shape in the world after the end of World War II. I agree that the situation may have changed. Let's assume there is a desire on the part of those who perceive the change to install new mechanisms of ensuring international security. But pretending, or proceeding from the assumption that Russia has nothing to do with it, and trying to exclude it from this process is hardly feasible. When we talk about our opposition to NATO's eastward expansion, we do not have in mind our special ambitions with respect to some or other regions of the world. Mind you, we have never declared any region of the world a zone of our special interests. I prefer to talk about strategic partnership. A zone of strategic interests in any region means above all the interests of the people who live in that particular region. Our main concern is our own country, its place in the world today and tomorrow. When we are confronted with attempts to exclude us from the process of decision-making, this naturally causes concern and irritation on our part. But that does not mean we are going to shut ourselves off from the rest of the world. Isolationism is not an option.  I have twice been to the United States on very short visits, on business. And I have been to Britain a couple of times at the invitation of the Foreign Office together with the former Mayor of St Petersburg Mr Sobchak. We went to Edinburgh, London and Manchester. Manchester and St Petersburg are sister-cities and have for a long time maintained very close ties. That was at the start of the 1990s, or the end of the 1980s, when it became clear that the proclaimed standards of living, which the then leadership wasn't bold enough to revise or declare unrealistic, that those standards of living were unreachable with the help of the economic mechanisms that were then in place. Secondly, my concern became particularly strong when it became clear that the best achievements of our fundamental and applied science could not be implemented on the obsolete technological basis we then possessed. What made matters worse is my clear realization that the technological basis could not be developed properly within the framework of the economic system that had been built on Russian territory for the past 70 years. This awareness came to me in the middle or late 1980s. You know, we have our own heroes, and they are not fiction. I have never wanted to be a James Bond. But working in state security bodies was something I had always wanted – since I was in school. Just as many young people get all the various ideas, ambitions, that was not my only ambition. I also wanted to be a pilot, a seaman. And then at some stage I got this bug to work for national security, and foreign intelligence at that. It is true. On the whole, yes. Working with information in general – and foreign intelligence is primarily information – is always productive and stimulating. But I also want to say that the outer side of this activity – you have mentioned James Bond – did not appeal to me that much. What did attract me was probably based on some books and films. In the Soviet Union, they never stressed the glamour, but what they did foster was a sense of patriotism, love of your country. Victory is only possible when every citizen of this country feels that the values we promote yield positive changes in their day-to-day lives. That they're beginning to live better, eat better, feel safer and so on. But in this sense one can say we are still very far from our goal. I think we are still at the start of that road. But I have no doubt that the road we have chosen is the right one. And our goal is to follow this road, and to make sure our policies are absolutely open and clear for the majority of the Russian people.;2000;NO;YES;YES;Regex-Yes / LLM-No;2440;YES;
393;I don’t think we should see anything unusual or unexpected in the way relations between Poland and Russia have shaped up over the past decade. It is a natural period of building mutual relations on a new basis. Why is it natural? Because one must not ignore and one must honestly admit that the former Soviet Union tried to dominate not only Eastern Europe, but many other parts of the world. It did little good to the Russian people and it certainly could not have elicited a positive reaction from our quasi-partners, our partners against their will. It certainly was against the will of the Poles, freedom-loving people who tolerate no diktat. It is no accident that this period saw the emergence of political forces which not only took advantage of the situation but tried to get political mileage out of it forgetting the basic interests, the national interests both of the Russian and Polish peoples. But change has to mature. I think that a revival in Russian-Polish relations is now on the agenda precisely by virtue of the pragmatic, mutual underlying interests of the two countries I have just referred to. And such interests exist. Poland is interested in having full-scale, healthy relations with Russia just like Russia is interested not only in economic, but also in political relations with Poland. And in the new world the comparative sizes of our countries are not that important. To us Poland is an equal partner. This is the political basis on which we will seek to build our relations. And I do not have to tell you about the economic benefits. They are obvious even to ordinary citizens. We have proceeded on that basis in the last year and a half- two years and we will continue to act in this way. Our meeting today is a milestone event that completes the creation of a new platform and a new basis for moving forward.  Regarding it being a milestone and why we call it that, what we expect, and what the new quality of our relations that may emerge during and after this visit mean. I think we should speak about several dimensions of our interaction. The first is in the sphere of security and the building of new and equitable relations in Europe and the world. For us, cooperation with Poland is important for several reasons: in terms of building new relations between Russia and NATO, in terms of the future accession of Poland to the EU and the building of Russia’s relations with the united Europe. Several considerations of a pragmatic character, to use an expression that has cropped up several times during this news conference, are emerging on the agenda. We have a whole plan of interaction with the united Europe in the energy sphere and in other fields. Poland is best placed to use its geographical position and its special relations with Russia, its knowledge of Russia to play its part not only for itself, but also for the whole of Europe, and, in my opinion, it can make a very real difference for the ordinary citizen you have referred to. I must say that this is uppermost in our minds.  For example, today we had a very hands-on discussion on our energy dialogue. We have plans of cooperation with other European countries on gas supplies, but do ordinary people in Poland know that buying gas from countries other than Russia would cost 25–30% more? It is more expensive today and it is likely to be still more expensive tomorrow. The same can be said of our interaction in the energy industry. Our interaction in some hi-tech areas is so close and intensive that it can compete with the efforts of our partners and rivals from other countries. All these are practical results that make a difference to the life of the ordinary citizen. The reason is that the interests of politics, security, the economy and the social sphere are closely intertwined in the modern world. We will address the whole range of issues, which gives us reason to claim that we are entering a new phase in our relations because we take a comprehensive approach to these relations on a new basis and with an understanding that such cooperation benefits both Poland and Russia.  <…> Regarding financial compensation to the people who suffered during the Stalin purges, I will try to be utterly frank with you and I hope that you will bear with me. We do not want to compare and equate the problems connected with Nazism and the Stalin reprisals, the aggression of Nazism in Europe, Poland and the Soviet Union and the reprisals under the Stalin regime. At the same time we are not going to turn a blind eye to the negative aspects of the Stalin regime. As you know, we have passed a law on the rehabilitation of the victims of political repressions. It applies above all to the Stalinist period of Soviet history. I think Polish citizens who had suffered during that period can well invoke that law. I think the Russian Government may try to create conditions that would offer, in a practical way, access for Polish citizens to exercising their rights under that law on an individual basis. We have discussed this topic with the President, he raised it and for my part I have instructed the Government to think about creating, if necessary, a legal or administrative basis for dealing with that problem.  I feel positive about it and I welcome it. I have already spoken in the beginning about the role President Kwasniewski has played in the last one and a half to two years in the building of relations between Russia and Poland. I should tell you that to some extent it set an example to me of how one should work professionally and consistently to promote interstate relations relying, among other things, on personal contacts. We have indeed developed a very good relationship. We are on first-name terms with the President and that of course helps us to deal with the challenges facing us. I have no doubt that it will continue to be the case and I find it very appealing that we can openly discuss practically any topic, as the President has said. There are no taboo topics between us, which is very important. It creates a very good atmosphere for tackling the most complicated issues. And I would like to stress that Mr President’s approach to any problem is constructive and very friendly, which always makes one feel like reciprocating. You see, I don’t want to discuss the second term now. I have to complete my first term so that the voters, the people of Russia are satisfied with my performance during the first term. As regards the chances of my visiting Poland, with your permission I would like to visit Poland in my capacity as the President of the Russian Federation and after I step down and live the life of a normal ordinary citizen. I hope such a time will come. Poland is a very attractive country in terms of European history. Polish culture has always evoked a particular interest in Russia, in effect, it is classical European history. So, like all the Russian people, I have a very keen interest in Poland. There are things to see, places to visit and I will avail myself of Mr President’s invitation and I hope to be able to visit Warsaw many times. As regards the first part of your question, you have touched upon one of the most pressing problems with which we are wrestling. I regret to say that we have still not been able to establish effective interaction on the issue with the European Union. We have repeatedly raised the issue and we all – the leaders of the European Union and Russia – are aware of the complexity of the problem which is drawing relentlessly closer and closer. With the admission of new members to the European Union a Russian enclave will be formed in the Kaliningrad Region and the problem will affect not only the residents of that region, but also the European Union: how would people move and travel and visit other parts of the Russian Federation? How would they cross the border when going west?  The Kaliningrad Region has a population of 1.3 million. We cannot surround them with a fence and keep them locked in. It will not only be our problem, but a problem for the European Union. So we have proposed to tackle the problem at once, before the European Union enlargement, to tackle it within the working group which we have proposed to create together with the European Union, Poland and other potential EU members. At the political level everybody is in favour and everybody understands what needs to be done, but we have yet to start practical implementation of our plan. So I vigorously support President Kwasniewski’s proposal that bilateral work on the issue should be intensified both with Poland and Lithuania. Mr President has proposed that the heads of these countries meet in Kaliningrad and that we meet with the European Union leaders there too. I think this is a positive step forward and we intend to give it every support and indeed initiate such meetings in order to solve all these problems. ;2002;NO;YES;YES;Regex-Yes / LLM-No;1717;YES;
5594;"Good afternoon, congratulations on yesterday’s holiday, the day we traditionally celebrate as Students Day. It was a pleasure to be shown around your university. You have plenty to be proud of here of course. I think that you all see and understand this for yourselves. The level of your professors and teachers, the university’s equipment, and the whole way the teaching process is organised are all things you can be proud of. It is good to see that we have universities of this level in the engineering field. This is particularly important for Russia. It is important in any country of course, but especially for Russia with its immense territory and mineral resources. This is excellent to see and I congratulate you on this.  I thought today was an ordinary day, but you are still celebrating the holiday. You have a big programme of work. The rector spoke about this. You are working in the interests of Russian companies, and in foreign companies’ interests too? Where were you, at what institution? This should continue because our education system needs to be an organic part of the global education system. This is the only way to maintain our level, get a sense of what our partners are doing, develop the main areas ourselves and exchange information. This is all very important and should continue. We will do this of course. We just visited a laboratory where the experts told us about what is happening there. I agree with you; we need to discuss this more often and more specifically, in order to promote it and attract talented young people to engage in science. We even have a special direction in one of our state programmes, “Promoting Science,” and we have experts who are working on this very issue. I believe it was in 2010, that a group of people who are working in this very area received the State Prize. But, of course, it is insufficient. I think it is not enough. Sadly, as you know, few people probably even know about your institute, although overall, we can be quite proud of this university and we need to demonstrate it as an example. Yes, but certainly not everyone, I can assure you. So our colleague is right: we need to talk about this more frequently and with more focus and professionalism, to motivate people to get an education, to develop, to do research. We will try to work on it. I walked by and saw the banner, but I think I saw karate as well. As a participants or a judge? I was the university champion of Leningrad. Is a university tournament being held now? Very well. I am simply unfamiliar with your base. I will certainly talk it over with the Federation, they will get in touch with your club and discuss it, why not? I will talk with the Minister as well, it’s a good idea. If your base meets the requirements, we will certainly hold a tournament there. Good luck to you. Do you practice it? Have you been doing it for long? Wow, that’s a long time. What are your results? I wish you success. This programme was in effect for five years. Overall, we channelled a significant amount of money here through the programme, somewhere around 85 billion rubles. 85 billion is a lot. And when it was completed, we created the Russian Scientific Fund and the money went there. So the Russian Scientific Fund is working on this, it has a whole programme to support young researchers. Presidential Aide Andrei Fursenko is here; he essentially runs the fund. Mr Fursenko, how much of the fund’s money is earmarked to support young researchers? We have made provisions in the Russian Foundation for Basic Research and the Russian Humanitarian Scientific Fund to allocate resources for supporting young researchers. I like how you say “it is known.” That is true, I agree with you. I see it as a very positive thing. Moreover, you may not see that we are creating a whole system for these types of qualifications through the Government; the Government received relevant instructions. Recently, we discussed practically the same issue at the Council for Science. The Government, together with the Academy of Sciences, the Presidential Council for Science and employers’ associations are developing a whole system for post-university training and accreditation. This is exceedingly important. To make things clear, a person must receive something like a professional passport so that employers understand whom they are dealing with. It is true, you are right – this is not developed enough in Russia, but it must certainly be done. They are more interested in this than anyone, but strangely enough, it was hard to get things going. We talked about this extensively, but did fairly little. Nevertheless, I think that in the last year, this issue got off the ground. We will certainly continue developing this project. We have met with colleagues when the work had just begun; they came to the White House when I was Prime Minister and we discussed it and allocated a certain amount of money, but I suppose this was insufficient. We will see what else we can do. I know the work is extensive, very interesting and important. They also told me that it was difficult to determine how long the surface of the lake was isolated from the surface of the rest of the planet – perhaps millions of years. Of course, these studies are extremely important. We will see what else we can do. Classes have stopped there? This is a very painful issue you have brought up here, one that concerns the serious and tragic events in Ukraine. Essentially, a civil war is underway there. I think that many in Ukraine understand this very well now. Regrettably, the government in Kiev has refused to take the road of a peaceful settlement and does not want to resolve the problem through political means. First they used the law enforcement agencies, then the security services, and then the army. Later, when they ran up against resistance, they suspended military operations, but sadly, they only used the temporary peace to regroup and then start their operations again. They are pursuing these operations again now. Thousands of people have already been killed. This is certainly a real tragedy.  We often speak of the ‘Ukrainian army’, but who is doing the fighting there in reality? Yes, in part it is official armed forces units, but a substantial part of those doing the fighting come from the so-called volunteer nationalist battalions. Essentially, this is not an army but is a foreign legion, in this particular case, a NATO foreign legion, which is not pursuing Ukraine’s national interests of course. They have completely different goals, related to achieving their geopolitical aim of containing Russia, and this is absolutely not in the Ukrainian people’s national interests.  Unfortunately though, we have the situation we see before us now. We need to help the people there. Incidentally, many people are trying to get out of being called up for duty. Some are trying to come here to Russia and wait things out a while here, and they are right to do this because there, they are simply being sent as cannon fodder to face the bullets. The problem is though, that under the new law, Ukrainian citizens cannot spend more than 30 days at a time in Russia. So they go back home and get caught and sent off again to face the bullets. We will therefore probably make some changes. Within the law’s provisions, we could increase the amount of time certain categories of people, above all people of conscript age, can stay in Russia. Regarding your question, of course we need to help the students. We would have to ask the rector about the possibilities, but you could make use of distance learning technology, invite them here for internships, and simply come up with a support system for them. I will definitely talk to them. Last year, we allocated… (Addressing Presidential Aide Andrei Fursenko) How many places in our universities did we allocate to students from Ukraine last year? We allocated additional budget-subsidised places in 18 Russian universities. Your partners from the Donetsk institute could of course get support from your university, one of our country’s top universities. Let’s think about how to go about it. We do need to help the students. <…>";2015;NO;YES;YES;Regex-Yes / LLM-No;1627;YES;
4;No, they aren’t. The amount of work is about the same, but there is more responsibility, of course. But this has nothing to do with a chair or office. I’m surprised that such questions arise. I thought everything was going according to plan. The plan has remained unchanged, and nothing unusual has happened to make us think about changing it. The only exception was a break in fighting during the holidays – Christmas and Muslim Uraza-Bairam. Our opponents asked us to suspend hostilities, and we agreed. We all know how they used the break – attacked two villages, Shali and Argun. I must say that our military handled this with high professionalism and resolve. In fact, the attacks were more of a propaganda operation, but they were dangerous. There were no losses among Defence Ministry forces, but the Interior Ministry had some casualties. I cannot say that the people in charge of the operation did everything right, as they should have done. In some cases the terrorists outwitted them. We have learned a lesson from our mistakes. But let me emphasize that the situation in Chechnya has not changed, and believe me, it is not going to change. Let me tell you something. It has only occurred to me now because you are talking in terms of weakness and strength. It is not about weakness. What we have is democratic institutions and policies versus terror and crime. Our actions towards our adversaries comply with Russian laws, whereas they use terror against us. This is why it happens the way it does. If we could detain and arrest people not for two or three days as set out in the Russian Criminal Code, but for 10, 20, 30 or 60 days, many things would be different. This is the main reason, and it also explains why the statements made by our military are sometimes inaccurate. I am going to tell you something that I’ve never said before. In conformity with the law on terrorism, we have a presidential decree on establishing the Counter-terrorist Operational Headquarters.  Yes. The decree has put the Defence Minister in charge of it. Let me repeat that this decree, issued last year, is fully in line with the law on countering terrorism. All reports to the mass media at Defence Minister level can be treated as official information. Everything below this level is current operational information, and may or may not be accurate. I’d like to comment briefly on the first part of your question. You said that people have taken a very favourable attitude to the operation in Chechnya. I don’t think this is the case. I believe people want order in Russia, including the North Caucasus. I am convinced that we are acting in the North Caucasus on behalf of the Russian people. They are sick and tired of our laxity and irresponsibility. As for the media coverage, I would agree with you that it is probably not up to the mark. I think this is partly because the federal forces have advanced practically through Chechnya’s entire territory, and have approached mountain areas, whereas the information support has been left behind on the liberated territory, as it were. Yes. This is because the Counter-terrorist Operation Headquarters has not yet established an agency that would supply official information. NATO invaded a third country whereas we have been conducting an anti-terrorist operation on our own territory. In some ways, it is easier, in others it isn’t because our own citizens are at risk, and we must think about them. On the other hand, I think you will agree that reports on the operation in former Yugoslavia should not be taken at face value. Today we know the other side of this coverage, and it was not our invention. British MPs report that today’s exhumations show that civilians had not been shot by anyone. They were not killed by bullets but by bomb fragments. This is an about-face from what we saw when events were unfolding in Yugoslavia. It is possible to say that everything was done properly there – properly in the interests of those who conducted the operation there. Here I agree with you. Sure. There should not be any concern about this. The generals have done nothing to deserve punishment. They have been awarded with the Hero of Russia titles, and they have earned them. Nobody has been replaced, not to mention demoted. Formal changes are made only in response to the changing situation. Troshev commanded in the east, and Shamanov was in charge in the west. Now that their troops have approached the mountains, in the south, the zone of direct hostilities and operations has narrowed down to two, three, or four points. Their deputies can well cope with the tasks involved. This does not mean that the zone of their responsibility has been reduced. To the contrary, it has been expanded. They continue to be in charge of what is happening in the south of the republic, and are responsible for their directions on the entire territory where they operated before. Nothing has changed in this sense. Let me repeat that the zone of their responsibility has been increased rather than reduced. Their deputies are in charge of combat operations that the armed forces are conducting in these narrow points. This was an absolutely natural decision that was agreed with them. It does not mean at all that they have been moved or removed. I’ve already said this, and will repeat it once again – these people deserve the deepest respect and have made a great contribution to the success of this counter-terrorist operation. Russia is not dumping generals like Vladimir Shamanov and Gennady Troshev. We see the problem differently. I’ve already discussed it with you. We consider Chechen civilians our citizens and will never sacrifice them to any military objectives. We will never do that. As for the operation’s duration, it will be determined by military expediency. Our actions will be tough but not cruel. What does that mean? Let me remind you what has been happening until now. Say, our troops have approached a village. If people from certain buildings offer armed resistance – I emphasize the adjective “armed” – that threatens the lives of our troops, these buildings will be destroyed. But if there is no resistance, if civilians oust the terrorists from their villages risking their own lives, we will cooperate with them. We will not simply cooperate and welcome such actions by civilians – we will win them over to our side. Only by gaining broader local support will we achieve final success – not with carpet bombings. Yes, it will take time and patience. But it is the only civilized solution to the problem. Any other solution will not merely be useless for achieving our objectives in Chechnya, but it will not be accepted by our own people. You see, it would be a heavy burden for Russia. If we win this way, it will be a heavy burden for the entire country. I don’t think we should try to achieve our goals by such means. You are underestimating the role of women. It is true that during hostilities and by virtue of certain traditions, relations are taking a different shape there. But you shouldn’t underestimate women – they play an important role in Muslim countries as well. As for resolving major problems by political instruments, we first have to make sure that we have these instruments. This is very closely linked with what we’ve just discussed. If we decide to employ any means to reach our objectives, we will never create an environment for political settlement. There will be nobody to negotiate with, except for men aged 10–12, children. Neither women nor adult men will talk to us if we treat them with cruelty.  We do. Let me show you. First, we will gain complete control of Grozny. Second, we will complete our operations in the mountains, no matter who might be hiding there in the caves. This has nothing to do with the elections or any other political events in the country. If we tailor counter-terrorist operations involving loss of human lives to some political campaigns, we will lose both ways and make a mess. This is a separate subject. We must consult the Chechen population, and find out how they see their own future. This will be a political process, and it can move in many directions. The law offers us various solutions. I doubt it. You know, Maskhadov has turned into a complete puppet in terrorists’ hands. Where is he? He still wants to meet with us. OK, we are ready to meet with him on certain terms. Let him return the hostages and denounce the bandits, the terrorists that we already know. Is he doing any of that? He has been hiding in the mountains, rushing from one village to another, and leaking discrediting information about our servicemen. On the whole, we have the impression that he has stopped being an independent political figure, if he ever was one. If he acts on his own, he is welcome. But I think that his is a lost case, and not only as a negotiator for us – he hardly has any chance among the Chechens. Now people have realized what has been happening in the last few years. They have understood that they have been simply cheated. Look at what is happening there – abject poverty side by side with palaces. What money have they been built with? At whose expense? Yes, it is grotesque, because the level of poverty has gone beyond any limits. At the same time, there are palaces that were built quite recently with money from who knows where. I mean we do know where it came from. Either from the use of resources, such as oil, which belong, by the way, to the Chechen people, not to one or two bandit ring leaders. Or this money could have been stolen from the federal budget – the money we transferred to Chechnya for pensions and social payments. Over the past three years nobody has received either pensions or wages there. I’m very pleased to hear this question from you. I think that the election campaign without a smear war means that we shouldn’t juggle with facts. We shouldn’t fan up tensions in society. We must react to real violations of the law on a daily basis, not during the election campaign. Incidentally, this is a duty of law-enforcement agencies. This means that we should conduct this campaign in the spirit of the values we talked about at Christmas. There are many values there. As I’ve already said, it is the law-enforcement agencies that should deal with the facts. This can and should be public knowledge, but should not be timed to election campaigns. Mr Dorenko, “as they say” is all hearsay… This is absolutely untrue. We have no intention of creating any super-elite units. You are the first to tell me this. But if we want our bodies of authority to employ honest people that were not involved in any under-the-carpet deals, but will proceed from hearsay and tell our conclusions to a multi-million audience, we will be involved in a foul play. Before telling our potential voters and TV audiences anything, we must verify this information and only quote authentic facts. And I’ve replied to your question. This is not true. We are not planning to set up any super special service, and I don’t have any such plans on my agenda. No such agreement exists. I’ve never discussed it with Mr Primakov. We had met only once in the presence of other people. If you remember, we met when I invited the parliamentary parties’ leaders of the former Duma and the heads of the movements that had been elected to the State Duma of the third convocation. This was a general meeting. We had no special conversations about this, and no agreements. As for my influence… I have this influence primarily because of my consultations with the leaders of the parties that have been elected to the State Duma. But these consultations were very general, and I did not dictate anything to them because they are generally very independent and self-sufficient. Of course, we have our agreements sometimes. I’m not indifferent to what the future State Duma will be like. But it is important to make sure that it reflects reality, and is not the product of some covert agreements, even if they are made by esteemed people. The correlation of major seats in the future State Duma should reflect the real alignment of political forces and attitudes in society. Positions that influence lawmaking in the country should not be occupied as a result of behind-the-scenes intrigues. The existence of a parliamentary party means that a certain number of voters gave it their support. The party then has the right to be represented in the Duma accordingly, and influence the lawmaking in parliament, and hence, the nation’s life and future. This is a slight exaggeration. If you remember, it was after that meeting that I said the nation had moved from one campaign to another, whereas some people had not yet finished their own campaign in the Moscow Region. I said Mr Seleznyov was still taking part in this campaign, and wished him success on behalf of all parliamentary parties. I said this quite casually but my phrase was immediately picked up both by Seleznyov’s opponents and supporters. I should probably have been more cautious in making such remarks, but I hope Mr Seleznyov and I will work well together. I’ve said this before and I sincerely believe so. We had good working relations with the previous Duma. I don’t know whether this is right or wrong but I say what I think, and what I say reflects reality. For instance, we’ve agreed with the Duma on key issues such as the budget and certain laws. We’ve managed to develop a good working relationship. This wasn’t easy. Sometimes we argued – members of the government would not leave the Duma until 5 a.m. But we’ve come to terms, and I think this is a very important signal for society in general, a signal to unite. We’ve shown that we can work together. Shouldn’t I talk about this? Why should I keep it secret? Well, this risk is always there, but one has to make some fundamental decisions. It is not worth saying what someone else wants to hear. I believe I should always say what I think and what has to be said. If I make one mistake after another, I’ll have to revise something. I’ll have to listen to my critics. First, under the Constitution this decision is made not only by the President, but also by the State Duma. Second, Kasyanov is not the worst candidate for the post. Third, since the Chairman of the Government must be endorsed by the Duma, this person should be a figure that suits many, but should also be capable of performing the difficult duties of the prime minister.;2000;NO;NO;YES;Regex-Yes / LLM-No;2903;YES;
7423;"Colleagues, welcome to this traditional meeting. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the leadership, staff and veterans of the diplomatic service for their efforts to protect Russia’s national interests and for their contribution to international cooperation. The Ministry’s central office, our embassies and all other Russian missions abroad are acting professionally in a coordinated manner, fulfilling the tasks set before them. Russia is pursuing a responsible and independent foreign policy in a dynamically developing and eventful global situation.  I would like to point out that Russia’s active involvement in global affairs is driven by our priority national interest, which is to create favourable and safe conditions for the country’s breakthrough development, for attaining large-scale social and economic goals and for improving the quality of life for the people. Our people want Russia to be a strong, independent and peaceful state. We are open to partnerships, to mutually beneficial and constructive relations with all countries and regional associations.  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia will continue to defend the fundamental principles documented in the UN Charter, which are sovereignty, equality of states, non-interference in other countries’ domestic affairs, and the just resolution of disputes. We believe that by observing international law and working together we can deal with the most complex world problems. The world undoubtedly needs our approach to ensuring global security and stability, countering new threats and challenges. Russia’s views on the best basis for a modern world order are supported by our allies in the CSTO, the CIS, BRICS and the SCO share. We all understand that they account for a large part of the world’s population. We have acted and will continue to act based on our principled positions when dealing with acute regional crises. It was with Russia’s decisive role that international terrorism, ISIL and other extremist groups suffered a crushing blow in Syria. This allowed Syria to maintain its statehood and create conditions for its economic recovery and the return of refugees.  I want to once again thank our military personnel who courageously performed and continue to perform their professional duty, and, of course, diplomats who are as extensively and selflessly involved in the Syria issue. With Russia’s active diplomatic efforts, the Astana process is moving forward. The Syrian National Dialogue Congress held in Sochi earlier this year was a significant achievement that deserves the closest attention, study and support. These efforts are laying a legitimate foundation for Syria’s revival. Now on the agenda is the organisation of the Constitutional Committee to prepare for constitutional reform and subsequent elections, with support from the United Nations. Of course, it is extremely important that the international community intensify its efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the Syrians. We are working on this. This is clearly important for Syria and the rest of the region, as well as for many other countries, because our active efforts can reduce the migration pressure on European countries. Russia also proposed a solution for the Korean Peninsula involving collective efforts and dialogue. We joined forces with China to draft a plan for the gradual normalisation of the situation there. It is good that the ideas proposed in that plan have been applied and that the sides have launched negotiations, showing respect for each other and refraining from actions that can have irreparable consequences. We hope that these positive trends, which were made possible also thanks to the contribution of US President Donald Trump, will continue to develop. However, we have seen cases where agreements reached through concerned efforts were derailed overnight. I am referring to the unilateral US decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear programme. This document is of crucial significance for global non-proliferation. Our task is to preserve this vital arrangement and to prevent the growing tension in the Middle East from getting out of control. There is a serious risk of aggravation of the situation in south-eastern Ukraine. The reasons are the same as always: non-compliance of the Ukrainian authorities with their own commitments and refusal to settle the conflict peacefully. Time and again, we see open disregard for the agreements, as well as an unwillingness to talk to their own people and a reliance on military scenarios. We believe that the Minsk Package of Measures provides fundamental grounds for a political settlement of this crisis. Colleagues, our foreign policy efforts are not aimed at achieving some kind of speculative greatness or creating problems for others. Let me reiterate that what matters most is ensuring the right conditions for the sustainable development of our country. In the years to come, Russia must not only firmly establish itself among the world’s top five economies, but also substantially improve the key standards related to the quality of life of its citizens. To achieve these strategic objectives we must make full use of our foreign policy opportunities. It is important that we focus our efforts on achieving specific, pragmatic results, tap new markets, expand exports and gain access to advanced technology and investment, while overcoming the obstacles and limitations Russian companies face in foreign markets. In today’s world, the principles of competition and openness in global trade are increasingly replaced by protectionism, while economic gain and expediency are swapped for partisan agendas and political pressure. Economic ties and entrepreneurial freedom are being politicised. Against this backdrop, Russia’s foreign policy must run counter to this trend by being more economically driven and rational. Creating a space of good neighbourly relations, wellbeing, security and stability along the entire perimeter of our state border has special importance. The Eurasian Economic Union is a key integration project for Russia. It is gratifying that our partners are guided by the same priorities as we are within the EAEU, and we implement them together quite effectively. The essence of these approaches is to use the opportunities arising from the integration processes to stimulate economic growth in all member countries so that citizens and businesses benefit from this cooperation. We also believe in the importance of stepping up EAEU contacts with other countries. Its free trade area with Vietnam has been launched, and talks are underway with Israel, Serbia and Singapore. Consultations with Egypt and India are to begin soon. A temporary agreement paving the way to the creation of a free trade area with Iran has been signed. All in all, there are about 50 proposals aimed at establishing partnerships with the Eurasian Economic Union. Good prospects are opening up due to joint efforts with China resulting from the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation signed in May between Beijing and the Eurasian Economic Union. The Eurasian Economic Union and the Belt and Road Initiative are efficiently complementing each other. Harmonisation of these projects can lay the foundation for establishing a Greater Eurasian Partnership – an economic cooperation space that is as free as possible from all barriers. We should apply the same logic to developing relations with the European Union, which remains one of our major trade partners despite current difficulties. We have many overlapping economic interests with the EU. Our common transport and energy infrastructure has been developing for decades. I would like to emphasise that all the business projects that we are implementing with Europe, including, for instance, Nord Stream 2, are solely commercial and economically viable; they are not politically charged and have no hidden agenda. The key to providing security and safety in Europe is in expanding cooperation and restoring trust, and not in deploying new NATO bases and military infrastructure near Russia’s borders, which is what is taking place now. We will respond appropriately to such aggressive steps, which pose a direct threat to Russia. Our colleagues, who are trying to aggravate the situation, seeking to include, among others, Ukraine and Georgia in the orbit of the alliance, should think about the possible consequences of such an irresponsible policy.  We need a new, positive agenda aimed at collaboration and attempts to find common ground. Of course, I discussed this during my meeting with the President of the United States, Mr Trump. With our views being different on many matters, we agreed that Russia-US relations are deeply unsatisfactory and in many ways even worse than during the Cold War. Of course, it would be naive to believe that the problems that piled up over years would be resolved in a matter of several hours. No one was counting on this. However, I believe that we have embarked on a path to positive changes. Importantly, a full-fledged summit with an opportunity to talk directly has finally taken place. It was overall successful and led to productive agreements. We will have to wait and see, of course, what turn the events will take, all the more so as certain forces in America are trying to downplay and disavow the results of the Helsinki summit. To digress from the main subject, I would like to say a few words on a personal note, so to speak. We see that there are forces in the United States that are willing to sacrifice Russia-US relations to promote their ambitions amid the domestic political strife in America. They are ready to sacrifice the interests of their businesses, which are losing multimillion-dollar contracts and the Russian market in general, as well as jobs in the United States, even though not many, but still there are jobs in place as part of cooperation with Russia. We are talking about tens of thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands, of jobs. They are ready to sacrifice the interests of their allies in Europe and the Middle East, in particular, those of the State of Israel. Among other things, we discussed security at the Golan Heights during the operation in Syria. Apparently, no one is interested in it. They are ready to sacrifice even their own security. I would like to say that the New START Treaty will expire in 2021. Generally speaking, we could have lived without it even several years ago, but we took the correct step when we signed it. Unless we start working right now to coordinate its extension, it will cease to exist in a year and a half. We will simply not have this treaty. When I spoke about these forces, you know, this does not fit our political philosophy, because we have always been taught that officials working in the interests of the state, of society must think above all about and give priority to these fundamental interests. Unfortunately, there are forces in the United States that put their narrow group and party interests before national ones. Our famous satirical writers once wrote about such people, “Miserable, wretched people!” But this is not quite so, at least not when it comes to this case. These are not miserable or wretched people. No, they are powerful and strong people who can shove – sorry for the mauvais ton – unbelievable and illogical stories in the face of millions of their citizens. Yes, they can really do this.  I am not saying this to scold or commend anyone. Absolutely not. I am saying this so that we take this into account in our practical work in the American direction. These are the facts of modern life, Nevertheless, Russia is open to further contacts with the United States on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. This is what not only our people but the world as a whole need. As the world’s largest nuclear powers, we have special responsibility for strategic stability and security. Colleagues, let me say a few words on a different topic. The 2018 FIFA World Cup ended just a few days ago. Not only the heads of state and government from many countries visited Russia, but also, and most importantly, hundreds of thousands of football fans from all across the world, who saw with their own eyes the real Russia: open, friendly and modern. This is an obvious success and a breakthrough in what is known as public diplomacy. This is attributable, among other factors, to your contribution to preparing this large-scale event. I would like to thank you for your efforts. Colleagues, it is obvious that the workload for the Foreign Ministry’s central office and all of Russia’s embassies will not subside moving forward. There is a lot of work for you ahead, and each and every one of you has immense responsibility.  Make no mistake: the country’s leadership remains committed to ensuring the material wellbeing and enhancing the professional status of diplomats, as well as improving social security for Ministry workers. A number of decisions has been taken to this effect. At the same time, some sensitive matters, including that of pay, social guarantees for family members, retirement pensions and housing, have yet to be addressed. Of course, the Government will work on it. I would like to ask the Government to keep these matters under control and prevent any formalistic or bureaucratic approaches. Let me emphasise that these efforts are aimed at ensuring that diplomats can exercise their professional duties in an enabling environment, which is extremely important in terms of increasing the efficiency of our foreign policy efforts in general. <…>";2018;NO;YES;YES;Regex-Yes / LLM-No;2478;YES;
1010;"Ladies and gentlemen, I am truly happy to once again welcome to Moscow President of Bulgaria Mr Georgi Parvanov. His first official visit to Russia is dedicated to a significant event – the 125th anniversary since our countries established diplomatic relations.  I am certain that the visit will become a serious step on the way to bolstering bilateral ties. I would like to say straight away: the talks confirmed our common desire to develop bilateral interaction, and this position is reflected in the Joint Declaration we signed today.  The agreements we signed today on cooperation between the highest judicial instances of our states, as well as on cooperation in cinematographic sphere, are an important step in the development of bilateral legal-contractual relations and the improvement of the legal framework.  During the talks, we noted that Russo-Bulgarian ties have been making dynamic progress in all areas. Accordingly, the bilateral trade turnover increased by a quarter in 2003 and reached almost half a billion dollars, while in the first quarter of this year, the figure was already almost half a billion dollars. Our common task is, of course, not to rest on what we have achieved.  We see great prospects for the development of cooperation in the energy sphere, machine building and tourism. Russian businessmen have plans to take part in the modernisation of production and transport infrastructure, in investment projects and programmes. Our close cooperation will have a real effect on making the national economies stronger. The ongoing Russo-Bulgarian business forumm, we believe, is an entirely modern and highly promising initiative. I am certain that it will facilitate more enhanced contacts between our countries’ industrialists, entrepreneurs and financiers.  For decades, closeness of spiritual and cultural traditions have been at the basis of Russo-Bulgarian relations. And, of course, today, as in the past, contacts in the field of science, art and education are considerably enriching our interaction. Obvious proof of this came in the form of the success of the last year’s Days of Russian Culture in Bulgaria and the Days of Bulgarian Culture in the Russian Federation.  I would also like to mention the forum of Slavonic cultures; Russia and Bulgaria played an active role in seeing it established.  We dedicated a considerable part of our meeting today to international problems. We pointed to the need to bolster up stability and security, develop joint efforts to counteract global and regional threats. These include local conflicts, terrorism, organised crime and drug trafficking.  Naturally, one of the key subjects at the talks was increasing confidence in security and stability in the Balkans. We again confirmed that our approaches here completely coincide. Russia positively views Bulgaria’s stabilising role in South East Europe. In our opinion, it would be highly useful and promising to discuss multilateral initiatives and projects in this part of Europe.  In conclusion, I would like to stress that I have the most positive view of the results of our talks and I am certain that they will make a significant contribution to the development of bilateral contacts. Thank you. Indeed, President Parvanov and I have developed very close cooperation in the last few years and I think this is positively reflected in the development of inter-state ties. We have already talked about how the trade turnover between our two countries increased by 25% in 2003 alone. Russian companies are playing an active role in the investment activity on the Bulgarian market. It would be enough to mention just one of our companies, LUKOIL, which has invested more than $400 million in the Bulgarian economy. If equal conditions are created for Russian companies – and I would like to stress not privileged, but just equal with other parties of the investment activity in the Bulgarian market – then I am certain that Russian investments will grow many times. Our companies have shown interest in investing in the energy sphere – above all the traditional electricity sector: we are ready to invest in thermal electric power stations by either buying part of these assets or even leasing them. We are prepared to expand our joint activity in the nuclear energy sphere, and increase, if the need arises, supplies of natural gas to Bulgaria itself and the neighbouring countries. We are interested in taking part in the Bulgagaz privatisation processes and in increasing the volume of oil and gas we pump through Bulgaria to other countries. As the Bulgarian President has already said, our transport ministries have agreed on expanding their activities right up to opening ferry lines and other crossings. We have other areas of interaction and cooperation that we believe to be highly promising. All this, plus the development of humanitarian ties – the Days of Bulgarian Culture held in Russia and, reciprocally, the Days of Russia in Bulgaria were, in my view, a great success – all this put together gives us reason to believe that our meeting was not merely a matter of words, but facilitated the development of inter-state ties.  As to the second part of your question, concerning the development of Bulgaria’s relations with international organisations such as NATO and the European Union, it is Bulgaria’s choice and we cannot influence these processes, and they do not particularly worry us. However, there are, of course, problems that we should discuss in good time as Bulgaria’s joining the European Union will involve some consequences in the economic sphere. There are certain limitations and we know this. Our experts and specialists know this too. We are energetically engaged in the negotiation process with the European Union on enlargement problems. This process obviously affects the Bulgarian economy. We also talked about this today and agreed that our specialists should work on an inter-governmental commission to prevent any possible negative outcomes for the two countries’ economies. I would like to point out that Russia and Bulgaria are both interested in preventing these possible negative outcomes.  With NATO, Russia, as you know, itself is ideveloping relations within the framework of the Russia-NATO Council. Both sides will decide how to ensure their security independently, depending on what each side considers to be its national priorities. ";2004;NO;YES;YES;Regex-Yes / LLM-No;1148;YES;
