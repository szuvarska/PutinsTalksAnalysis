321,2012-12-21 18:00:00,"We are not advocates of the incumbent Syrian leadership yet we believe that in order to reach long-term agreements, we need to first agree on what will happen to Syria in the future, how the interests of all its citizens, all religious and ethnic groups will be secured, how the nation will be governed, and only after that we can begin implementing that plan.",syria,[]

343,2013-01-23 17:40:00,Lebanon’s government has taken a principled decision of non-intervention in Syria’s domestic affairs in order to protect our country from possible negative consequences.,syria,[]
343,2013-01-23 17:40:00,"The National Dialogue Committee stated this decision in the Baabda Declaration, but unfortunately, the continuing crisis and the worsening situation with Syrian refugees, who are fleeing the country in their tens of thousands, create a heavy burden for Lebanon.",syria,[]

347,2013-01-24 12:30:00,"Just look at what is happening in the Middle East and in Africa: the conflict in Syria has been ongoing for almost two years; the turmoil in Libya, accompanied by the uncontrolled proliferation of arms, contributed to the exacerbation of the situation in Mali.",syria,[]
398,2013-02-28 18:00:00,"Despite the nuances differentiating Russian and French positions, we both favour maintaining an integral, democratic Syrian state.",syria,[]

558,2013-06-16 20:30:00,One of them is Syria.,syria,[]
558,2013-06-16 20:30:00,"On the question of supplying arms to Assad’s government and the question of who has the Syrian people’s blood, including the blood of children, on their hands, I am sure none of you would deny that both sides have blood on their hands.",syria,[]
558,2013-06-16 20:30:00,"But, laying emotions aside and taking a purely working approach to the issue, let me note that Russia delivers arms to the legally recognised Syrian government in full accordance with the rules of international law.",syria,[]
558,2013-06-16 20:30:00,"What’s more, I fully agree with the Prime Minister that this is probably one of the most probable, productive and acceptable ways to try to resolve the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
559,2013-06-17 18:45:00,"Furthermore, we will discuss many international issues, including, of course, Syria.",syria,[]
560,2013-06-17 23:45:00,"Naturally, we discussed problem spots on the planet, including Syria.",syria,[]
560,2013-06-17 23:45:00,"There are still some aspects where our positions do not align, but we are united by a common aspiration to stop violence, stop the growth of victims in Syria and resolve the problem by peaceful means, including with the help of talks in Geneva.",syria,[]
562,2013-06-18 19:40:00,"Naturally, Syria received a great deal of our attention in a discussion on pressing international topics.",syria,[]
562,2013-06-18 19:40:00,"We called on our G8 partners to engage in purposeful work to convene a conference in Geneva, the so-called Geneva 2, on ending the bloodshed in Syria.",syria,[]
562,2013-06-18 19:40:00,"As far as Syria is concerned, this was another topic that we discussed at length yesterday.",syria,[]
562,2013-06-18 19:40:00,We agreed that rights should absolutely be granted to all of Syria’s ethnic and religious groups within the framework of these efforts.,syria,[]
562,2013-06-18 19:40:00,We do not have any facts about the use of these weapons by the Syrian government.,syria,[]
562,2013-06-18 19:40:00,I assure you that not all the G8 members believe it was used by the Syrian army.,syria,[]
562,2013-06-18 19:40:00,"Moreover, earlier, the government of Syria itself appealed to the United Nations with a request to investigate what they believed was the use of chemical weapons by the opposition.",syria,['itself']
562,2013-06-18 19:40:00,But there was never a case when Russia was alone in defending its approaches to resolving the problem in Syria.,syria,[]
562,2013-06-18 19:40:00,"Overall, I can assure you that this was a general discussion, a very engaged discussion between people who want to find unified, common and effective approaches to resolving the Syrian problem.",syria,[]
571,2013-06-21 17:30:00,"As for foreign policy issues such as Syria, there were other problems discussed as well, but I think Syria is the most pressing issue today, and this was an entirely open and engaged discussion.",syria,[]
571,2013-06-21 17:30:00,"Russia is supplying arms to the incumbent and legitimate government of the Syrian Republic in line with international law, under open and transparent contacts.",syria,[]
571,2013-06-21 17:30:00,"But it is clear that without supplies from abroad, the events happening today in Syria would simply not be possible.",syria,[]
571,2013-06-21 17:30:00,Each has their own opinion regarding the current problems not just in Syria but in other regions of the world as well.,syria,[]
571,2013-06-21 17:30:00,"Basically, I can once again confirm what I said in the United Kingdom: it is hard for me to imagine why anyone would supply arms to those armed opposition groups in Syria, whose composition is not fully clear to us.",syria,[]
571,2013-06-21 17:30:00,"If the United States and the US Secretary of State recognise one of the key Syrian opposition organisations, Jabjat al-Nusra, as a terrorist group and officially recognise its connection to Al-Qaeda, how can they supply arms to that opposition?",syria,[]
571,2013-06-21 17:30:00,We feel that only the Syrian people themselves can guarantee a long-term solution to all the problems that have accumulated there over many decades.,syria,[]
573,2013-06-21 19:00:00,"<…> Let's start with Syria, because the first question doesn’t exist.",syria,[]
573,2013-06-21 19:00:00,As for Syria and weapons supplies.,syria,[]
573,2013-06-21 19:00:00,"I can accept your thesis that Assad is using these weapons in the fight against his own people but with a big proviso because it is not the Syrian people that are fighting with Assad but the rebels, who are well-trained and well-armed, including by other countries and including through terrorist organisations.",syria,[]
573,2013-06-21 19:00:00,"Whether Assad should stay or leave, what the political leadership in Syria should be like, what structure should be adopted – that is not for you or for us to impose on the Syrian people from abroad.",syria,[]
573,2013-06-21 19:00:00,"We can encourage for the negotiation process, and only the warring parties in Syria can agree on the future structure, and only in that case will that structure be robust and long-term.",syria,[]
573,2013-06-21 19:00:00,"Regarding the question on Syria and the conference on Syria, I think we should take the results of the G8’s work and make a real effort now to build the framework conditions for reaching the needed decisions.",syria,[]
573,2013-06-21 19:00:00,We estimate that roughly 600 people from Russia and European countries are fighting on the side of the Syrian armed opposition.,syria,[]
600,2013-07-07 14:30:00,Syria has already devolved into civil war.,syria,[]
663,2013-08-31 14:00:00,"With regards to this case specifically: as you know, the Syrian government already asked the international community to conduct inspections, as they believed that rebels had used chemical weapons.",syria,[]
663,2013-08-31 14:00:00,Syrian government troops are on the offensive.,syria,[]
663,2013-08-31 14:00:00,"Therefore I am convinced that [the chemical attack] is nothing more than a provocation by those who want to drag other countries into the Syrian conflict, and who want the support of powerful members of the international community, especially the United States.",syria,[]
663,2013-08-31 14:00:00,"But I have not had such discussions with Mr Obama in recent days, especially after new charges that the Syrian Government has used chemical weapons.",syria,[]
663,2013-08-31 14:00:00,"I hope that the President of the United States will be among the [G20] participants, and we will certainly have the opportunity to talk in an expanded format, including about the Syrian problem.",syria,[]
663,2013-08-31 14:00:00,The Syrian government’s army is on the offensive.,syria,[]
668,2013-09-04 09:00:00,But we have no evidence that these chemical substances – it is not clear yet whether it was a chemical weapon or just some harmful chemical substance – have been used by the Syrian Army.,syria,[]
668,2013-09-04 09:00:00,No restrictions have been imposed by the UN on the supplies of weapons to Syria.,syria,[]
668,2013-09-04 09:00:00,"However, bearing in mind that the situation around Syria remains acute and disputed and that we have not yet been able to reach an overall agreement on this pressing issue, the leaders of 20 major economies of the world could definitely use the opportunity to spend some time discussing this issue at their meeting in St Petersburg.",syria,[]
668,2013-09-04 09:00:00,"We will not insist on it though, but we may propose to go beyond the scope of discussions planned and spend some time to consider the Syrian issue.",syria,[]
669,2013-09-04 18:10:00,<…> Regarding Syria.,syria,[]
669,2013-09-04 18:10:00,"As you know, Syria is not attacking the US, so there is no question of self-defence, and anything else lacking UN authorisation is an act of aggression.",syria,[]
669,2013-09-04 18:10:00,"Just now, as we started discussing Syria… our opponents’ positions are very weak, if we are to be honest.",syria,[]
669,2013-09-04 18:10:00,"There is no explanation or justification for the aggression, other than that the Syrian army used chemical weapons.",syria,[]
669,2013-09-04 18:10:00,But they came to the verdict that they [the Syrian army] used chemical weapons even before the UN inspectors completed their work.,syria,[]
669,2013-09-04 18:10:00,"And finally, regarding our human rights advocates’ possible trip to Syria.",syria,[]
669,2013-09-04 18:10:00,But the regular Syrian army is fighting against a wide variety of people.,syria,[]
677,2013-09-06 17:00:00,We indeed spent much of Thursday night discussing Syria and related issues.,syria,[]
677,2013-09-06 17:00:00,"I cited the countries whose governments support the exacerbation of conflict in Syria, who support external strikes.",syria,[]
677,2013-09-06 17:00:00,"Second, I would like to remind you that using force against a sovereign state is only possible in self-defense; but Syria is not attacking the United States.",syria,[]
677,2013-09-06 17:00:00,We only talked about Syria but did not say a word about this issue.,syria,[]
677,2013-09-06 17:00:00,"South Africa’s President said a very remarkable thing, which, in my opinion, is important in every respect, not just with regard to Syria.",syria,[]
677,2013-09-06 17:00:00,Will we be helping Syria?,syria,[]
677,2013-09-06 17:00:00,"We have a different take on the situation in Syria, and everyone is aware of it.",syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,"It is a well-known fact that Syria has a chemical weapons arsenal, and Syrians have always regarded it as a counterbalance to Israel’s nuclear stockpile.",syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,"Given the current situation in Syria, this issue is particularly pressing, and we did discuss this matter on the margins of the G20 summit in St Petersburg.",syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,"In fact, the matter of bringing Syria’s chemical weapons under international control has long been a subject of discussion by experts and politicians.",syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,"On September 9, we heard US Secretary of State John Kerry saying in a public statement in London that the US thinks this is extremely important for the resolution of the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,"With the foreign minister of Syria currently on a visit to Moscow, our Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov     Lavrov SergeiForeign Minister of Russia  talked to him, and he then talked to his country’s leadership, and we hear that Syria responded positively to this proposal.",syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,"Not only do we think this is a viable option, but we really hope that our friends in Syria take this responsible decision and agree not only to bring their chemical weapons under international control but also to have them destroyed, and we hope Syria joins the international convention banning chemical weapons.",syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,I think this will be a big step forward in resolving the Syrian crisis.,syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,"Of course, all of this will only mean anything if the United States and other nations supporting it tell us that they're giving up their plan to use force against Syria.",syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,"You can’t really ask Syria, or any other country, to disarm unilaterally while military action against it is being contemplated.",syria,[]
683,2013-09-10 21:00:00,"We will work together with Syrians and our US partners, and, like I said, I hope this will be a big step forwards towards a peaceful resolution to the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,Recent events surrounding Syria have prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders.,syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,"The planned strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the Pope, will result in more innocent victims and escalation, spreading the conflict far beyond Syria’s borders.",syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,"Syria is not witnessing a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multi-religious country.",syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,There are few champions of democracy in Syria.,syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,"Might they not return to our countries with experience acquired in Syria, as happened in Mali following the events in Libya?",syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,"From the outset, Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future.",syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,"We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law.",syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria.,syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,"But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists.",syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,"In the United States, many draw an analogy between Iraq and Syria, and ask why their government would want to repeat recent mistakes.",syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,"The United States, Russia and all members of the international community must take advantage of the Syrian government’s willingness to place its chemical arsenal under international control for subsequent destruction.",syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,I welcome the President’s interest in continuing the dialogue with Russia on Syria.,syria,[]
685,2013-09-12 08:00:00,"If we can avoid force against Syria, this will improve the atmosphere in international affairs and strengthen mutual trust.",syria,[]
687,2013-09-13 10:00:00,"In any case, as you know, we are actively pushing the initiative to place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control.",syria,[]
687,2013-09-13 10:00:00,We think this is a very important initiative and hope for its successful implementation in order to create the conditions for peaceful resolution of the Syrian crisis.,syria,[]
688,2013-09-13 10:15:00,"As you have already noted, Syria is at the centre of attention right now.",syria,[]
688,2013-09-13 10:15:00,We consider unacceptable any external military intervention in Syria’s affairs without the United Nations Security Council’s sanction.,syria,[]
688,2013-09-13 10:15:00,The initiative to place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control is very important in this respect.,syria,[]
688,2013-09-13 10:15:00,Reports are coming in that Syria’s representative in the United Nations has announced that Syria wishes to become as from today a full-fledged party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.,syria,[]
688,2013-09-13 10:15:00,I think we should welcome this decision by the Syrian government.,syria,[]
688,2013-09-13 10:15:00,I hope that this will be a real step towards resolving the Syrian crisis.,syria,[]
688,2013-09-13 10:15:00,It confirms our Syrian partners’ serious intent to take this road.,syria,[]
690,2013-09-13 15:30:00,The Russian Federation’s initiative on Syria and the steps the Syrian government has taken give us hope that we will be able to avoid a new war in the region.,syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,I saw that President Obama took the discussion on the possibility of attacking Syria to the Congress and Senate.,syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,We have equal rights and equal responsibilities with all our colleagues involved in the discussion on Syria.,syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"They used an ancient, Soviet-made projectile, taken from the Syrian army’s armaments from a long time ago – it even had “Made in the USSR” printed on it.",syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,But this was not the first time chemical weapons were used in Syria.,syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"In this respect, I can only express my regret that our American colleagues did not react to our parliamentarians’ proposal and refused to receive them in Washington for a discussion on Syria.",syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,Am I right in understanding that you are asking about whether it is the threat of military strikes that plays a part in Syria’s agreeing to have its weapons placed under control?,syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"So far it looks as though Syria has fully agreed to our proposal and is ready to act according to the plan that the international community is putting together, working through the UN.",syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,Syria has declared that it will join and that it indeed already considers itself to have joined the International Chemical Weapons Convention.,syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,These are practical steps that the Syrian government has already taken.,syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"Syria got itself chemical weapons as an alternative to Israel’s nuclear arsenal, as we know.",syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"First of all, I do not think that the initiative to put Syria’s chemical weapons under [international] supervision contributed, as you said, to saving President Obama’s face.",syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"Russia has not special interests in Syria, and that is not what we are trying to protect by supporting the current government.",syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"This would be a blow to the world order, not simply to Syria.",syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"Weapons began flowing in, fighters began arriving in Syria.",syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"I won’t deny that he really surprised me at the G20 summit, when he suddenly announced that Italy cannot support the plans for a strike against Syria.",syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,Concerning Syria.,syria,[]
699,2013-09-19 19:45:00,"You see, I feel it is wrong to talk now about what we will do if the Syrian government does not fulfil its promises.",syria,[]
701,2013-09-23 14:45:00,The CSTO cannot ignore as serious an issue as the Syrian conflict.,syria,[]
701,2013-09-23 14:45:00,The armed groups operating in Syria did not come out of nowhere and will not disappear into nowhere.,syria,[]
701,2013-09-23 14:45:00,"It is in our common interests to settle crises through diplomatic means that open the way for political settlement and stabilisation of the situation in a country, including in Syria, which I mentioned just now.",syria,[]
701,2013-09-23 14:45:00,"We will need to work on finding common approaches to this problem, which will be reflected in a statement of the CSTO member countries on Syria.",syria,[]
701,2013-09-23 14:45:00,"I just mentioned Syria and the terrible, bloody events in Kenya, but we somehow overlook other no less terrible events.",syria,[]
703,2013-09-23 16:50:00,We gave much attention to the Syrian crisis too.,syria,[]
703,2013-09-23 16:50:00,The CSTO member countries are unanimous in saying that we need to settle the situation in Syria exclusively through peaceful political means.,syria,[]
703,2013-09-23 16:50:00,Such a development of events would inevitably further destabilise the situation in Syria itself and in the Middle East in general and would have a negative effect on the region under our organisation’s zone of responsibility.,syria,['itself']
703,2013-09-23 16:50:00,Russia is grateful to its CSTO partners for their support of our efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the crisis and for supporting the Russian-US proposals regarding Syria’s chemical weapons.,syria,[]
703,2013-09-23 16:50:00,"This consolidated position is reflected in the CSTO member countries’ Statement on Syria, which was approved today.",syria,[]
713,2013-10-02 16:50:00,"Question (retranslated): Mr President, Russia has just played an important and constructive role by helping to resolve the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
713,2013-10-02 16:50:00,"Judging by the work underway on destroying Syria’s chemical weapons though, I think we have every reason to think that we are on the right path.",syria,[]
713,2013-10-02 16:50:00,I think that if we continue to work in this kind of coordinated fashion we will not need to use force and add to the number of dead and wounded in Syria’s longsuffering land.,syria,[]
723,2013-10-07 14:40:00,"We have only limited time today, but I would like to exchange views with you on a wide range of issues, including humanitarian exchanges between our countries, economic issues, talks on concluding a peace treaty, the situation in Syria and more.",syria,[]
724,2013-10-07 18:50:00,"We have been able to achieve coordinated decisions on the most difficult matters, with Syrian issues being the latest example.",syria,[]
724,2013-10-07 18:50:00,"As you mentioned, our close cooperation to resolve the Syrian crisis and the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula serve as strong evidence of this.",syria,[]
725,2013-10-08 12:00:00,"With regards to Syria, our differences were first and foremost tactical.",syria,[]
725,2013-10-08 12:00:00,"After all, the US does not want Al-Qaeda to come to power in Syria, isn’t that right?",syria,[]
725,2013-10-08 12:00:00,"In general, we share common goals related to stabilising and democratising the situation in Syria, and creating conditions for the peaceful coexistence of all peoples who live there, people of all faiths, religions, and ethnicities.",syria,[]
725,2013-10-08 12:00:00,I must say that doubts about whether Syria’s leadership could adequately respond to the [UN Security Council] resolution regarding the elimination of chemical weapons did not materialise.,syria,[]
725,2013-10-08 12:00:00,"The Syrian leadership, Syria very actively engaged in this work, and is acting in a very transparent way, helping international structures eradicate chemical weapons from the country.",syria,[]
725,2013-10-08 12:00:00,"The Syrian people must decide Assad’s fate, and not Russia’s leadership or that of any other country.",syria,[]
725,2013-10-08 12:00:00,"Only the Syrian people can use their sovereign right to determine their country’s future, its organisation, and choose their own leaders.",syria,[]
725,2013-10-08 12:00:00,"Naturally, first and foremost, our conversation in this context addressed Syria.",syria,[]
725,2013-10-08 12:00:00,This is precisely what the Secretary of State and I talked about: we discussed the prospects for destroying chemical weapons in Syria and how we can build our future work in this and several other areas.,syria,[]
736,2013-10-21 17:30:00,"We discussed in depth the situation in the Middle East, North Africa, and above all, in Syria.",syria,[]
740,2013-10-23 14:00:00,"It is very important that this approach has the understanding and support of most countries with regard to the very complex situation in Syria, and that the international community is now concentrating its efforts on preparing for the Geneva 2 peace conference.",syria,[]
752,2013-10-29 18:00:00,Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation to Syria Azamat Kulmukhametov is being awarded the Order of Courage.,syria,[]
790,2013-11-20 22:00:00,We are calling for a rapid end to the bloodshed in Syria and hope to see continuation of talks in Geneva.,syria,[]
795,2013-11-22 16:00:00,"Of course we discussed international issues too, the situation in the Middle East in general and the situation in Syria in particular.",syria,[]
795,2013-11-22 16:00:00,The situation in Syria is worsening every day and innocent people are dying there every day.,syria,[]
795,2013-11-22 16:00:00,"As for the humanitarian issue, you know, I have not had any contact with the Syrian president, Mr Assad, since 2007.",syria,[]
795,2013-11-22 16:00:00,"People might hold different views, but no one disputes that fundamentalist groups are actively fighting in Syria and are behaving in very ruthless fashion.",syria,[]
795,2013-11-22 16:00:00,"Ultimately, we both share the aim of bringing peace to Syria and preserving its territorial integrity.",syria,[]
795,2013-11-22 16:00:00,I completely agree with the Prime Minister when he says that we should lose no time and that we should let the Syrian people decide their own future.,syria,[]
795,2013-11-22 16:00:00,"Russia took the responsibility of convincing the Syrian leadership, and we have carried out this part of the work.",syria,[]

1040,2014-06-04 22:20:00,"This is why we would like the legal authority to remain in power in Syria, so that Russia can cooperate with Syria and with ours partners in Europe and the United States to consider possible methods to change Syrian society, to modernise the regime and make it more viable and humane.",syria,[]

1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"Then they hear that they can get more money elsewhere, and so they go there, and then they capture oil fields in Iraq and Syria say, start producing oil, and others buy this oil, transport it and sell it.",syria,[]

1283,2014-12-01 20:55:00,I have already outlined our approach to the situation in Syria.,syria,[]
1283,2014-12-01 20:55:00,I want to redirect your question on whether we insist that Mr Assad stays in power to the Syrian people.,syria,[]

1283,2014-12-01 20:55:00,"Furthermore, I must say that there are certain technical complications related to the fact that our contacts with the Syrian leadership are limited, for obvious reasons, and we cannot directly affect all these processes, but we will try to do so.",syria,[]

1358,2015-02-09 01:00:00,We also should help to launch a dialogue between the Syrian government and its political opponents so that they could find mutually beneficial compromises and solutions themselves without any foreign pressure.,syria,[]
1358,2015-02-09 01:00:00,"In essence, the terrorists are trying to gain control over a huge part of Iraq and Syria with a population of nearly 10 million.",syria,[]
1358,2015-02-09 01:00:00,"Today’s developments in Syria and Iraq stem, among other things, from a heavy-handed and irresponsible interference from the outside into the affairs of the region and unilateral use of force, ‘double standards’, and differentiating between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ terrorists.",syria,[]
1358,2015-02-09 01:00:00,"Unlike Iraq, where the fight against terrorism is conducted in cooperation with the officials in Baghdad, in Syria the coalition refuses to work together with the legitimate authorities.",syria,[]

1627,2015-09-15 12:30:00,We support the Syrian government – I want to say this – in countering terrorist aggression.,syria,[]
1627,2015-09-15 12:30:00,"Clearly, without active participation by the Syrian authorities and military, without participation by the Syrian army, as the soldiers fighting with the Islamic State say, you cannot expel terrorists from this nation, as well as the region overall, it is impossible to protect the multi-ethnic and multi-faith people of Syria from elimination, enslavement and barbarism.",syria,[]
1627,2015-09-15 12:30:00,"Of course, it is imperative to think about the political changes in Syria.",syria,[]
1627,2015-09-15 12:30:00,"And we know that President Assad     al-Assad BasharPresident of Syria  is ready to involve the moderate segment of the opposition, the healthy opposition forces in these processes, in managing the state.",syria,[]
1627,2015-09-15 12:30:00,As if the refugee problem grew because Russia supports the legitimate government in Syria.,syria,[]
1627,2015-09-15 12:30:00,"First of all, I would like to note that the people of Syria are, first and foremost, fleeing the fighting, which is mostly due to external factors as a result of supplies of arms and other specialized equipment.",syria,[]
1627,2015-09-15 12:30:00,"And if Russia had not supported Syria, the situation in that nation would have been even worse than in Libya, and the flow of refugees would be even greater.",syria,[]
1627,2015-09-15 12:30:00,"Second, the support of the legitimate government in Syria is not in any way related to the flow of refugees from nations like Libya, which I already mentioned, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, and many others.",syria,[]
1627,2015-09-15 12:30:00,"But right now, as I said, we need to focus on joining forces between the Syrian government, the Kurdish militia, the so-called moderate opposition, and nations in the region to fight the threat against Syria’s very statehood and the fight against terrorism – so that together, with our efforts combined, we can solve this problem.",syria,[]
1638,2015-09-21 14:00:00,"As you know, Iran and Syria are arming the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah with modern weapons aimed against our citizens, and thousands of rockets have been launched against Israel’s people over these last years.",syria,[]
1638,2015-09-21 14:00:00,"At the same time, Iran, with the Syrian army’s help, is trying to establish a second terrorist front against us on the Golan Heights.",syria,[]
1638,2015-09-21 14:00:00,"Regarding Syria, I think we are all aware that the Syrian army today is not in a state to be up to opening a second front.",syria,[]
1638,2015-09-21 14:00:00,It has enough to do just trying to save Syria’s own statehood.,syria,[]
1640,2015-09-22 18:40:00,Both our nations are also concerned about the situation in Syria.,syria,[]
1646,2015-09-28 19:25:00,And now radical groups are joined by members of the so-called “moderate” Syrian opposition backed by the West.,syria,[]
1646,2015-09-28 19:25:00,"Having established control over parts of Syria and Iraq, Islamic State now aggressively expands into other regions.",syria,[]
1646,2015-09-28 19:25:00,"Today, we provide military-technical assistance to Iraq, Syria and other regional countries fighting terrorist groups.",syria,[]
1646,2015-09-28 19:25:00,We think it’s a big mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian authorities and government forces who valiantly fight terrorists on the ground.,syria,[]
1646,2015-09-28 19:25:00,We should finally admit that President Assad’s government forces and the Kurdish militia are the only forces really fighting terrorists in Syria.,syria,[]
1646,2015-09-28 19:25:00,"Above all, I believe it is of utmost importance to help restore government institutions in Libya, support the new government of Iraq, and provide comprehensive assistance to the legitimate government of Syria.",syria,[]
1647,2015-09-28 20:25:00,"As for the more acute issues in the world, with the fight against terror currently holding a particularly important place, we very much hope that we’ll be able to find common ground with all our partners – the Arab nations, Turkey, the United States and European nations – in order to find a common platform for fighting terrorism, to overcome national differences and work on them together with all interested countries, developing the process of political change in nations in the region, including Syria.",syria,[]
1647,2015-09-28 20:25:00,"However, without strengthening the state structures in the region’s governments, including in Syria, we cannot resolve any of these challenges; and if we waste time, then the terrorists will celebrate their victory.",syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,"I think that our American partners explained their position quite clearly on many issues, including settling the situation in Ukraine and Syria, as well as the Middle East overall.",syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,"Regarding Syrian territory, this is illegal; this is also something we spoke about today.",syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,Look what is happening: your colleague asked about airstrikes dealt at ISIS on Syrian territory by representatives of various states.,syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,"A few days ago, our military have calculated that US aviation made 43 strikes at Syrian territory within 24 hours.",syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,President Obama and I discussed various aspects of a settlement in Syria in general and combatting terrorist organisations on that country’s territory in particular.,syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,"These are not many: on Syrian territory, this is primarily the Syrian army and Kurdish resistance units, as I said in my address.",syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,We are considering what kind of additional support we could give to the Syrian army in fighting terrorism.,syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,I would like to stress that we believe that these anti-terrorist efforts should be made alongside political processes within Syria.,syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,"I have great respect for my colleagues – both the American President, and the French President – however, as far as I know they are not citizens of the Syrian Republic and therefore should not take part in determining the future of another state’s leadership.",syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,This is the Syrians’ business.,syria,[]
1651,2015-09-29 02:20:00,"At the same time, there are things that cause certain concern, that have to do with the airstrikes at Syrian territory.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"Concerning our, as you put it, presence in Syria, as of today it has taken the form of weapons supplies to the Syrian government, personnel training and humanitarian aid to the Syrian people.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"In this particular case, we act based on the request from the Syrian government to provide military and technical assistance, which we deliver under entirely legal international contracts.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,That is the army of Syrian President al-Assad     al-Assad BasharPresident of Syria .,syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"We provide, as I have said twice during our interview and can repeat again, we provide assistance to legitimate Syrian authorities.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"There is no other way to settle the Syrian conflict other than by strengthening the existing legitimate government agencies, support them in their fight against terrorism and, of course, at the same time encourage them to start a positive dialogue with the “healthy” part of the opposition and launch political transformations.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"I would like to advise or recommend them to forward this suggestion not to al-Assad himself, but rather to the Syrian people.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"It is only up to the Syrian people living in Syria to determine who, how and based on what principles should rule their country, and any external advice of such kind would be absolutely inappropriate, harmful and against international law.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"That is why we provide assistance to the legal government agencies precisely, but – and I would like to stress it again – we do it hoping that Syria will launch political transformations necessary for the Syrian people.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"Time and again, with perseverance worthy of a better cause, you are talking about the Syrian army fighting against its people.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,But take a look at those who control 60 percent of Syrian territory.,syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"60 percent of Syria is controlled either by ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra or other terrorist organisations, organisations that have been recognised as terrorist by the United States, as well as other countries and the UN.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,It is them and not anyone else who have control over 60 percent of Syrian territory.,syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"As for the refugees, Syria is not their only country of origin.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,Do the refugees come from Syria only?,syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,And why do you think that the Syrian refugees flee only as a result of President al-Assad’s actions to protect his country?,syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"Point number two is that we know for certain that today there are at least 2,000 and may be even more than 2,000 militants in Syria who are from Russia or other former Soviet republics and, of course, there is the threat of their return to Russia.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"So, I want you, your audience to finally realise that no one except for al-Assad's army is fighting against ISIS or other terrorist organisations in Syria, no one else is fighting them on Syrian territory.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"In Syria, there is no other force except for al-Assad's army.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"Russia will not take part in any field operations on the territory of Syria or in other states; at least, we do not plan it for now.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"It is anti-Syrian propaganda, there is nothing in common between al-Assad and ISIS, they fight against each other.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"We think that the issues of political nature should be solved in any country, including in Syria, primarily by its people – in this case by the Syrian people themselves.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,But we are ready to provide assistance both to the Syrian authorities and the healthy opposition for them to find some points of contact and agree on the political future of their country.,syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"We are not stepping into the vacuum of American leadership, we are trying to prevent the creation of a power vacuum in Syria in general because as soon as the government agencies in a state, in a country are destroyed, a power vacuum sets in, and that vacuum is quickly filled with terrorists.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"There are more than 2,000 militants in Syria from the former Soviet Union.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"So instead of waiting for them to return back home we should help President al-Assad fight them there, in Syria.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"Our actions in Syria are aimed at diverting attention from Ukraine… No, it is false.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"Syria is another issue; I have already told you that we are against disintegration, the terrorists coming to the country, the return of people who are fighting there for terrorists to Russia.",syria,[]
1652,2015-09-29 06:00:00,"Libya's state is disintegrated, Iraq's territory is flooded with terrorists, it looks like the scenario will be the same for Syria, and you know what the situation is in Afghanistan.",syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,Syria is the issue here.,syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,The only real way to fight international terrorism (and international terrorist groups are creating chaos in Syria and the territory of neighbouring countries right now) is to take the initiative and fight and destroy the terrorists in the territory they have already captured rather than waiting for them to arrive on our soil.,syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,"There is no need to be an expert to realise that if they succeed in Syria, they will inevitably return to their own countries, and this includes Russia.",syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,"Today, a number of countries, including the United States, Australia and France, are using their air forces to carry out air strikes against the Islamic State’s positions in Syria.",syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,"Our partners’ operations in Syria have neither of these things as their basis, but we nonetheless think it possible and necessary to unite the efforts of all concerned countries in the fight against international terrorism and base this common effort on the UN Charter.",syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,We have informed all of our partners about Russia’s plans and actions in Syria.,syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,Let me repeat: Russia’s involvement in the anti-terrorist operations in Syria is in accordance with international law and based on the official request from the President of the Syrian Arab Republic.,syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,I want to stress the point though that the conflict in Syria has deep roots and is the result of many factors.,syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,"First, we will support the Syrian army only in its lawful fight against terrorist groups.",syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,"Third, our support will have a limited timeframe and will continue only while the Syrian army conducts its anti-terrorist offensive.",syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,Our view is that a final and long-term solution to the situation in Syria is possible only on the basis of political reform and dialogue between all healthy forces in the country.,syria,[]
1654,2015-09-30 16:15:00,I know that President al-Assad     al-Assad BasharPresident of Syria  knows this and is ready for this process.,syria,[]
1655,2015-10-01 17:15:00,<…> (Regarding Syria),syria,[]
1655,2015-10-01 17:15:00,I dwelt in sufficient detail yesterday on what motivated our actions – other countries have been carrying out airstrikes on Syrian territory without a UN Security Council resolution or a corresponding request from the official Syrian authorities for over a year now.,syria,[]
1659,2015-10-06 15:45:00,There are developments in Syria; there is a crisis that affects everyone.,syria,[]
1661,2015-10-07 14:20:00,"Special thanks should go to the pilots at work in Syria, of course, and as this experience with using high-precision weapons shows, to the Caspian Fleet seamen.",syria,[]
1661,2015-10-07 14:20:00,"During my recent visit to Paris, the President of France, Mr Hollande, voiced an interesting idea that he thought is worth a try, namely, to have President Assad’s government troops join forces with the Free Syrian Army.",syria,['free']
1661,2015-10-07 14:20:00,"True, we do not know yet where this army is and who heads it, but if we take the view that these people are part of the healthy opposition, if it were possible to have them join in the fight against terrorist organisations such as ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and others, this would help pave the way to a future political settlement in Syria.",syria,[]
1661,2015-10-07 14:20:00,"As for our next steps, as we agreed, it will be synchronised with the Syrian army’s operations on the ground.",syria,[]
1661,2015-10-07 14:20:00,Our Aerospace Forces will provide effective support for the Syrian army’s offensive.,syria,[]
1666,2015-10-11 15:30:00,"As I just said, we will discuss the situation in the region, of course, the situation in Syria and other countries, particularly in light of the recent terrorist attacks in Turkey.",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,Let me say again that we are acting in full compliance with international law – at the request of the Syrian Arab Republic’s official government.,syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"All other countries that have so far taken part in operations in Syria are acting unlawfully, because there is no UN Security Council resolution on these operations, and no official request from the Syrian authorities.",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"Let me note that when we began our operation, 11 countries were already taking part in one form or another in various strikes against Syrian territory.",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,Simplest of all would have been for them to join our efforts and in this way bring their own operations on Syrian soil within the law at the same time.,syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"After all, if we have a mandate to act from the Syrian authorities, the simplest solution would be for others to join us and work within this same mandate.",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,This depends above all on the Syrian army itself and on the Syrian authorities.,syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,I said from the start that our active operations on Syrian soil will be limited in time to the Syrian army’s offensive.,syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"When you have ISIS and other such groups of international terrorists right next to the capital, who is going to want to look for a settlement with the Syrian authorities, sitting practically under siege right in their own capital?",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"On the contrary, if the Syrian army demonstrates its viability and, most important, its readiness to fight terrorism, and if it shows that the authorities can achieve this, this opens up much greater possibilities for reaching political compromises.",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,We have no such plans and our Syrian friends know this.,syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"Our General Staff specialists, working in coordination with our Syrian partners and other countries in the region have established an information centre in Baghdad, as you know.",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"Of course, there are risks, but let me say that these risks existed anyway, even before we began our operations in Syria.",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"If we just stood by and let Syria get gobbled up, thousands of people running around there now with Kalashnikovs would end up on our territory, and so we are helping President Assad fight this threat before it reaches our borders.",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,We have absolutely no desire to get entangled in inter-religious conflicts of any sort in Syria.,syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"Moreover, if all I heard were the usual propaganda clichés coming from the media and did not know what various countries’ leaders really think, we would perhaps not have decided to get involved in Syria.",syria,[]
1668,2015-10-12 09:00:00,"What’s more, it’s a well-known fact that the Americans have shut down the programme to train the Free Syrian Army.",syria,['free']
1669,2015-10-13 15:00:00,What does the situation with ISIS in Syria have to do with investments in Russia?,syria,[]
1669,2015-10-13 15:00:00,"First of all, I do not want to debate with anyone right now, but I will note that we are not striving for some sort of leadership in Syria.",syria,[]
1669,2015-10-13 15:00:00,There can only be one leader in Syria: the Syrian people.,syria,[]
1669,2015-10-13 15:00:00,"I will point out that all our actions, as I have said before, are in strict compliance with the UN Charter and international law – unlike our colleagues from the so-called international coalition led by the United States, which is acting without UN Security Council resolutions and without invitation by the Syrian authorities.",syria,[]
1669,2015-10-13 15:00:00,"Over this time (operations by international forces headed by the United States – or if we put it simply, the actions by the US – have been underway by over a year), they have engaged 11 nations in bombing, with over 500 strikes on Syrian territory, spending half a billion dollars, and that’s only officially, to train Free Syrian Army fighters to fight against ISIS.",syria,[]
1669,2015-10-13 15:00:00,"Now, it has been reported that the Free Syrian Army is being supplied with ammunition via aircraft.",syria,['free']
1669,2015-10-13 15:00:00,Where is this Free Syrian Army?,syria,['free']
1669,2015-10-13 15:00:00,"If they simply discharge or dump the ammunition and weaponry somewhere from the air, how can we know that it won’t all get into the hands of ISIS, as this happened during training of the Free Syrian Army personnel and arming it – what are the guarantees?",syria,['free']
1670,2015-10-13 16:40:00,"As regards Syria, they say we are overshooting targets there.",syria,[]
1675,2015-10-15 11:15:00,We briefed Mr Nazarbayev on the main results of the Normandy Four meeting in Paris and on the development of the situation in Syria and our actions to suppress terrorist activities in that country.,syria,[]
1675,2015-10-15 11:15:00,I do not really understand how our American partners can criticise Russia’s actions in Syria to combat international terrorism if they are refusing to have a direct dialogue in such an important area as political settlement.,syria,[]
1676,2015-10-16 10:40:00,"In this respect, we considered it our duty to take concrete action in the fight against the Islamic State and other radical groups on Syrian territory.",syria,[]
1676,2015-10-16 10:40:00,Our operation is limited in time too to the Syrian army’s offensive against the terrorists.,syria,[]
1676,2015-10-16 10:40:00,"From air and sea, we have been striking targets agreed in advance with the Syrian forces, and our service personnel have achieved some impressive results.",syria,[]
1676,2015-10-16 10:40:00,Of course we must act to make sure that these people do not put the experience they have acquired in Syria to use here at home later.,syria,[]
1679,2015-10-20 14:00:00,"By creating a stronghold in Syria and a number of other Middle East countries, the terrorists have been making plans to expand their activities and to destabilise entire regions; they have been hiring mercenaries from many countries, including, unfortunately, Russia and the CIS.",syria,[]
1679,2015-10-20 14:00:00,"To prevent this threat, to take preventive measures, Russia, as you may know, has launched a combat operation in Syria.",syria,[]
1679,2015-10-20 14:00:00,I would like to stress that the military assistance we are providing to the Syrian Arab Republic at the request of the country’s leadership fully meets Russia’s Military Doctrine and the norms of international law.,syria,[]
1679,2015-10-20 14:00:00,"Since September 30, the air group of the Russian Aerospace Forces has been destroying the militants’ infrastructure in Syria.",syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,We took the decision upon your request to provide effective aid to the Syrian people in fighting the international terrorists who have unleashed a genuine war against Syria.,syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,"The Syrian people has been practically alone in putting up resistance and fighting these international terrorists for several years now, and has suffered great losses.",syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,"This is a matter of concern for Russia too, given that sadly, people from the former Soviet Union, around 4,000 people at least, have taken up arms and are fighting on Syrian territory against the government forces.",syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,"On the question of a settlement in Syria, our position is that positive results in military operations will lay the base for then working out a long-term settlement based on a political process that involves all political forces, ethnic and religious groups.",syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,"Ultimately, it is the Syrian people alone who must have the deciding voice here.",syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,"Syria is Russia’s friend and we are ready to make our contribution not only to the military operations and the fight against terrorism, but also to the political process.",syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,President of Syria Bashar al-Assad     al-Assad BasharPresident of Syria  (retranslated):,syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,"First of all, I want to express our tremendous gratitude to the Russian leadership and people for the help they are providing Syria.",syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,Thank you for supporting Syria’s unity and independence.,syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,I must say that the political steps the Russian Federation has been taking since the start of the crisis made it possible to prevent events in Syria from taking an even more tragic turn.,syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,"Of course, our common goal is to bring about the vision the Syrian people have of their own country’s future.",syria,[]
1681,2015-10-21 09:40:00,I want to thank the Russian people once more for the help you are giving Syria and express the hope that we will vanquish terrorism and continue working together to rebuild our country economically and politically and ensure peaceful life for everyone.,syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"After Syria’s official authorities reached out to us for support, we made the decision to launch a Russian military operation in that nation.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"I am sure that the Russian service members’ actions will have the necessary positive effect on the situation, helping Syria’s official authorities create the conditions for subsequent actions in reaching a political settlement and stage pre-emptive strikes against terrorists that threaten our nation, Russia.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"First of all, free Syria and Iraq’s territories from terrorists and not let them move their activities to other regions.",syria,['free']
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"And to do that, we must join all forces – the Iraqi and Syrian regular armies, Kurdish militia, various opposition groups that have actually made a real contribution to fighting terrorists – and coordinate the actions of countries within and outside of the region against terrorism.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"Second, it is obvious that a military victory over the militants alone will not resolve all problems, but it will create conditions for the main thing: a beginning of a political process with participation by all healthy, patriotic forces of the Syrian society.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"It is the Syrians who must decide their fate with exclusively civil, respectful assistance from the international community, and not under external pressure through ultimatums, blackmail or threats.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"The collapse of Syria’s official authorities, for example, will only mobilise terrorists.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"It is clear that Syria will need massive financial, economic and humanitarian assistance in order to heal the wounds of war.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"Right now, Syria’s problems are being discussed at the UN and other international organisations, and within the framework of interstate relations.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,Approval of the Russian-American document on safety guidelines for the two countries’ military aircraft flying missions over Syria is a serious step in the right direction.,syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"For all the drama of its current situation, Syria can become a model for partnership in the name of common interests, resolving problems that affect everyone, and developing an effective risk management system.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"Now we face the serious issue of what is happening in Syria, and I am sure this will be the subject of further discussion.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,<…> How effective will our operations in Syria be?,syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"We hope that coordinated action between our strike aircraft and the other military systems being used, coordinated with the Syrian army’s offensive, will produce positive results.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,Is this enough to be able to say that we have defeated terrorism in Syria?,syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"What result can we speak of if the terrorists have reinforced their presence in Syria and Iraq, dug in deeper in the territory they had already taken, and expanded their presence?",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"The first operations between our armed forces and the Syrian armed forces have produced results, but this is not enough.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"On the question of Syria’s partition, I think this would be the worst-case scenario.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"If Syria were partitioned into separate territories, they would inevitably fight between themselves without end and nothing positive would come out of this.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,This is a matter for the Syrian people to decide.,syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"Finally, on how we see the political process, let me give a general outline now, but let me say at the same time that it is the Syrians themselves who must formulate this process, its principles and final goals, what they want and how they will achieve it.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"By the Syrians themselves, I am referring to the lawful government and the opposition forces.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"Of course, we take the view that the root causes of the conflict in Syria are not just the fight against terrorism and terrorist attacks, though terrorist aggression is clear and the terrorists are simply taking advantage of Syria’s internal difficulties.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"Certainly, the Syrian government must establish working contact with those opposition forces that are ready for dialogue.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,The Syrian army really is making gains with our support.,syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"As you know, it was in Baghdad that Iran, Syria, Russia and Iraq established an information centre, where we exchange information and set the main directions in the fight against terrorism, including against the Islamic State, but we have no plans to expand military operations involving Russia’s Aerospace Forces.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"Of the 34, I think (it’s around that number, anyway), cabinet members in Syria, more than half are Sunnis, and Sunnis are just as broadly represented in the Syrian army as in the government.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"Syria was always primarily a secular state, after all.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"I asked him, “How would you react if we see that there is an armed opposition in Syria today that is ready to genuinely fight terrorism, fight the Islamic State, and we were to support their efforts in this fight against terrorism just as we are supporting the Syrian army?”",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,Vladimir Putin (responding to a question on the possibility of air defence missile systems in the hands of the Syrian opposition):,syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"I hope not, because American leaders, although we disagree on many positions, are nevertheless sensible people and realise that these weapons could end up in the hands of those who will aim them against the American pilots who also fly over Syria – granted, they’re doing it unlawfully, but still do it.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"Our service members in Syria, of course, are fighting terrorism and in this respect, protect the interests of the Syrian people, but not only that.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,"And I assure you, the treat of terrorist strikes against Russia has not become greater or less due to our actions in Syria.",syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,We were not taking any action in Syria.,syria,[]
1686,2015-10-22 20:45:00,Now about Syria.,syria,[]
1687,2015-10-22 21:30:00,"Iran is making a very big and constructive contribution to the fight against terrorism, including in Syria.",syria,[]
1687,2015-10-22 21:30:00,Our position is that there can be no long-term and stable settlement in Syria without Iran’s participation.,syria,[]
1687,2015-10-22 21:30:00,It will be my pleasure to inform you during this meeting about my meeting and talks with Syria’s President al-Assad.,syria,[]
1695,2015-10-28 19:20:00,"We need to facilitate the political process, the process of finding political settlements to all matters of conflict, including in Syria.",syria,[]
1695,2015-10-28 19:20:00,"These days, you have a great deal of work related to the conflict in Syria.",syria,[]
1695,2015-10-28 19:20:00,"Of course, it is clear to me that in discussing issues like Syria and Ukraine, your main partner is the United States, but on the other hand, I nevertheless feel that Germany and the EU can be important partners as well.",syria,[]
1701,2015-11-03 20:10:00,"Indeed, our goal in Syria and anywhere else is to fight terrorism, first and foremost in this direction of our work.",syria,[]
1705,2015-11-05 13:50:00,"People who for some reason have found themselves outside Russia should be confident that we will always defend their interests, particularly in complicated, critical situations, such as in Libya, Syria and Yemen.",syria,[]
1706,2015-11-09 14:30:00,This has been convincingly demonstrated in the anti-terrorist operation that we are conducting at the Syrian government’s request.,syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"We hoped at least for the natural in such cases close military and expert coordination with the US‑led Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, even taking into account all the fundamental differences between the Russian and US approaches to the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"However, the reaction of the United States and Western partners was quite restrained, although it would seem obvious that ISIL and other similar extremist groups operating in Syria represent a clear common threat to our countries.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"We still have not managed to go beyond the joint approval of the Memorandum of Understanding on Prevention of Flight Safety Incidents in the Course of Operations in Syria, and even then with a reservation by the US that by no means such interaction should be regarded as the normalisation of military contacts, which were frozen on the US initiative.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"Neither have we received any response to our request to provide Russia with relevant US intelligence data for planning operations of our Russian Aerospace Forces in Syria, although we have repeatedly asked the United States for such information.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,We have even worked together with the Free Syrian Army (FSA).,syria,['free']
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"We are ready to cooperate with Washington despite the fact that the US operations in Syria are in violation of international law – without the resolution of the UN Security Council, without the request from the official Syrian government.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"As for the time frame of the operation in Syria, a clear objective is set before the Russian forces – they should provide air support for the Syrian army’s offensive against the terrorists, that is why the duration of stay of our servicemen will be determined solely depending on the time this objective is achieved.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"Our activities in Syria as well as potential risks and consequences have been carefully calculated many times, and all the resources needed for the operation, both financial and technological, have been allocated in advance.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,It is true that the two countries have different views on the ways to resolve the crisis in Syria.,syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"Indeed, from the very outset we have insisted, and we still insist today, that it is the Syrian people who should determine its future.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"It is good to know that at the Vienna talks on Syria on October 30, foreign ministers of seventeen states and representatives of the United Nations and the European Union supported this approach and expressed it in their final statement as their collective opinion.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"As for the elaboration of a detailed road map to settle the conflict in Syria, that is not our task.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,The map should be developed and adopted by the Syrians themselves.,syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"Yet, we have a few ideas about how external forces could help the Syrians to defeat the terrorists and resolve the crisis.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"Its constructive nature would to a large extent determine how successful we would be in translating the proposals into decisive joint actions which would help defeat ISIL and restore Syria as a unified, sovereign and secular state, create safe living conditions for everyone regardless of their ethnicity or faith, and open prospects for social and economic revival of the country.",syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,Let me repeat it once again – only the Syrians themselves should choose their future and their government leaders.,syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,We were guided by this very logic – the logic of international law – when receiving Syrian President Bashar al‑Assad in Moscow.,syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,Syria is a sovereign country and Bashar al‑Assad is its President elected by the people.,syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,It is based on the official request from the Syrian government that Russia is carrying out a military operation involving its Aerospace Forces in Syria.,syria,[]
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,"Moreover, we are already cooperating with that ‘moderate’ opposition, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA).",syria,['free']
1716,2015-11-13 16:15:00,And Russia has already submitted its suggestions on this account – this was done during the Vienna meeting of the Syrian Support Group.,syria,[]
1722,2015-11-16 17:40:00,"As for Syria, we must first decide – and the foreign ministers are working on this now – which groups we consider terrorist organisations, and which are simply armed but nevertheless a part of Syria’s healthy opposition, and focus our efforts on fighting the terrorist organisations specifically, in order to create conditions for a political settlement of the Syrian conflict.",syria,[]
1722,2015-11-16 17:40:00,"So yesterday, he and I had a long conversation about our bilateral relations and about settling the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
1722,2015-11-16 17:40:00,"First and foremost, this has to do with the fact that the President of Turkey, as he told me directly yesterday, feels that the Syrian crisis can only be resolved by political means, and we must create conditions for promoting this political process.",syria,[]
1722,2015-11-16 17:40:00,"But I can confirm that right now (on the battlefield, so to speak), we have established contacts with some (not all, of course) of the uncompromising, even armed Syrian opposition groups; they themselves asked us not to strike the territories they control.",syria,[]
1724,2015-11-17 11:10:00,"Our aviation should not simply continue military operations in Syria, but enhance them so as to make it clear to the criminals that vengeance is inevitable.",syria,[]
1726,2015-11-17 18:00:00,"As you perform combat missions to fight terrorists in Syria, you are defending Russia and its citizens.",syria,[]
1730,2015-11-20 17:40:00,"Please, a word on the work directly in the Syrian Arab Republic itself.",syria,[]
1730,2015-11-20 17:40:00,"I want to thank you all, but I note that this is not yet enough to cleanse Syria of terrorists and fighters and protect Russia from possible terrorist attacks.",syria,[]
1733,2015-11-23 18:10:00,"Still, all these operations will not go on forever; I stated earlier that they will be temporary and linked to the offensive operations by the Syrian army to suppress terrorist organisations.",syria,[]
1733,2015-11-23 18:10:00,"Inevitably, the Syrian crisis must still be resolved and will be resolved by political means.",syria,[]
1736,2015-11-23 23:00:00,"We will continue coordination in the fight against terrorism and strengthen cooperation within the framework of the International Group on Syria, including in order to carry out decisions on launching a comprehensive intra-Syrian political process.",syria,[]
1736,2015-11-23 23:00:00,(Answering a journalist's question on the situation in Syria.),syria,[]
1736,2015-11-23 23:00:00,"Today, I informed our Iranian friends about these matters and we exchanged views on the situation in Syria.",syria,[]
1736,2015-11-23 23:00:00,But I want to say again that there is no other option for resolving the Syrian problem in the long-term other than through political negotiations.,syria,[]
1737,2015-11-24 15:40:00,Our aircraft was shot down over Syrian territory by an air-to-air missile launched from a Turkish F-16 plane.,syria,[]
1737,2015-11-24 15:40:00,"It fell on Syrian territory, four kilometres from the Turkish border.",syria,[]
1738,2015-11-25 11:50:00,"As for measures to ensure the safety of our military flights in Syria, the proposals announced yesterday are not enough.",syria,[]
1738,2015-11-25 11:50:00,We will deploy an S-300 air defence system at our air force base in Syria.,syria,[]
1741,2015-11-26 14:00:00,"I expect a truly broad international anti-terrorist coalition to be formed that would act in a coordinated fashion, as a powerful force and would, in particular, support the actions of the Russian troops that are carrying out successful military operations against terrorist groups in Syria.",syria,[]
1741,2015-11-26 14:00:00,What happened two days ago in the skies over Syria is against common sense and international law: the plane was shot down over Syrian territory.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,We have already intensified the Russian Armed Forces operation against terrorists in Syria.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,We are confident that eradicating terrorism in Syria will create the necessary conditions for achieving a final and long-term settlement of the Syrian crisis.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,"We agreed to continue working together very actively within the framework of the International Syria Support Group and promote the fulfilment of all agreements reached within this group, first and foremost with regard to the deadlines and parameters for holding intra-Syrian talks.",syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,"Since 2011, the chaos in Syria has created a huge wave of refugees, over 300,000 people have been killed, and so now we must find a political solution to this crisis, but there are requirements for this that should be followed.",syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,"Last time we met in Paris, all four of us, we touched upon the Syrian issue and spoke about the need for coordinated actions.",syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,Our fight against terrorism in Syria does not affect France’s commitment to find a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,I believe that the fate of the President of Syria should be entirely in the hands of the Syrian people.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,"Moreover, we all agree that it is impossible to successfully fight terrorism in Syria without ground operations, and no other forces exist today that can conduct ground operations in the fight against ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and other terrorist organisations aside from the Syrian government army.",syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,"As for the territory you mentioned, where our servicemen died, indeed, Syria’s armed forces used multiple rocket launchers which we supplied recently to the Syrian army, in coordinated actions with our Air Force, and intensified strikes in this area right after we received credible information that one of our servicemen was killed and we were able to save the second one.",syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,And we feel it is absolutely justified to intensify the efforts of our aviation there and support the intensification of the Syrian forces’ efforts.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,We did not have these systems in Syria because our aviation is working at heights where the terrorists’ criminal hand cannot reach.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,"But the air defence system is not in any way directed against our partners, with whom we are fighting terrorists in Syria.",syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,"Consequently, our current objective is to try to avoid any incidents of this kind between the countries that are engaged in counter-terrorist efforts in Syria.",syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,These are industrial-scale oil supplies coming in from parts of Syria now in the terrorists’ hands.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,"These vehicles are loaded in Syria, in territory controlled by the terrorists, and they go to Turkey and return to Syria empty.",syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,Then the geographical scope of the coalition’s operations expanded to include Syria’s territory.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,France is also operating in Syria in keeping with coalition policy and the decision that I made in September.,syria,[]
1743,2015-11-26 22:30:00,"And we have this right because we know for a fact that the terrorists who acted in Paris and in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis were trained in Syria and, unfortunately, were trained very well to carry out these heinous terrorist attacks.",syria,[]
1749,2015-11-30 21:50:00,"We discussed bilateral issues, developing bilateral relations and, of course, the most pressing current problems, first and foremost the Syrian issue and options for its settlement.",syria,[]
1749,2015-11-30 21:50:00,"Overall, I feel we are on the same wavelength and all assume that we can resolve the Syrian conflict exclusively through political means.",syria,[]
1749,2015-11-30 21:50:00,"And I hope that our cooperation with French colleagues will go farther than with many others, that we will fight terrorism in Syria together on a practical level – I mean the agreements between our military agencies to coordinate their actions.",syria,[]
1749,2015-11-30 21:50:00,"We talked first and foremost about Syria, as well as things that should be at the forefront of our attention in the near future, including the list of what we consider to be terrorist organisations and the list of organisations that represent the healthy part of the Syrian opposition.",syria,[]
1751,2015-12-03 13:00:00,"Today here in the St George’s Hall, a historic hall of Russian military glory, we have combat pilots and representatives of the Armed Forces who are taking part in the anti-terrorist operation in Syria.",syria,[]
1751,2015-12-03 13:00:00,"The situation there is alarming and gives us no optimism, while some of the yet recently stable and rather well-doing countries in the Middle East and North Africa – Iraq, Libya and Syria – have now plunged into chaos and anarchy that pose a threat to the whole world.",syria,[]
1751,2015-12-03 13:00:00,The militants in Syria pose a particularly high threat for Russia.,syria,[]
1751,2015-12-03 13:00:00,This is why it has been decided to launch a military operation there based on an official request from the legitimate Syrian authorities.,syria,[]
1751,2015-12-03 13:00:00,"Our military personnel are fighting in Syria for Russia, for the security of Russian citizens.",syria,[]
1751,2015-12-03 13:00:00,We know who are stuffing pockets in Turkey and letting terrorists prosper from the sale of oil they stole in Syria.,syria,[]
1751,2015-12-03 13:00:00,Allow me to emphasise that they should know that we do not equate them with the certain part of the current ruling establishment that is directly responsible for the deaths of our servicemen in Syria.,syria,[]
1752,2015-12-03 18:00:00,I would like to thank you for the work you are doing in Syria.,syria,[]
1752,2015-12-03 18:00:00,"and as I have publicly said on many occasions, we are not only helping the Syrian people and the Syrian leadership.",syria,[]
1752,2015-12-03 18:00:00,Your job in Syria is to ensure that this does not happen in this country ever again.,syria,[]
1752,2015-12-03 18:00:00,"However, the Syrians will continue fighting there the way they are doing now.",syria,[]
1752,2015-12-03 18:00:00,"However, all the positive things that are happening there are only happening through your efforts, and those of your comrades who are working from the air and are in fact leading the Syrian combat units.",syria,[]
1756,2015-12-08 22:35:00,"We must certainly thank our service members in the special forces, the search and rescue unit, and the Syrian service members for retrieving this recorder, which will certainly help us determine what happened.",syria,[]
1766,2015-12-10 21:30:00,"You have the same open and objective information policy with regard to the events in Syria: today, we saw a great deal about this here as well, and overall, you are doing much to counter terrorism.",syria,[]
1767,2015-12-11 14:00:00,I’ll start with the events in Syria.,syria,[]
1767,2015-12-11 14:00:00,You know what prompted our decision to provide military assistance to the Syrian Arab Republic and begin active efforts in that country against international terrorism.,syria,[]
1767,2015-12-11 14:00:00,"Militants, including citizens of Russia and CIS countries, gained a strong foothold in Syria.",syria,[]
1767,2015-12-11 14:00:00,"All this is a direct threat to Russia, and our troops in Syria are first and foremost defending their country.",syria,[]
1767,2015-12-11 14:00:00,"I’ll say what’s most important: the comprehensive application of force by our aircraft and Navy, as well as the use of high-precision weapons systems, has allowed us to do serious damage to terrorist infrastructure, thereby allowing us to qualitatively change the situation in Syria.",syria,[]
1767,2015-12-11 14:00:00,I will particularly note that the work by our aviation group helps unite the efforts of Syrian government forces and the Free Syrian Army.,syria,['free']
1767,2015-12-11 14:00:00,"In addition, we support them from the air, same as we do with the Syrian army, assisting them with weapons, ammunition and materials.",syria,[]
1767,2015-12-11 14:00:00,"Overall, the actions of the Russian forces in Syria deserve a highly positive assessment.",syria,[]
1774,2015-12-15 17:20:00,We noted the proximity of our countries’ views on such pressing matters as resolving the Ukrainian crisis and combatting international terrorism in Syria.,syria,[]
1775,2015-12-15 18:30:00,"I know that after our meeting in Paris, the American side presented its ideas regarding ways to resolve a number of issues, including the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"Okay, I will talk about Syria in the end.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"You see, I had not heard about the Turkomans (Syrian Turks) before.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,We have increased our presence and increased the number of warplanes [in Syria].,syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,We are also adjusting the Syrian air defence system and have serviced the highly effective Buk systems that we had sent them before.,syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"Turkish planes used to fly there all the time, violating Syrian air space.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,The fate of the Syrian president.,syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"We believe that only Syrians can choose their leaders, establish their government standards and rules.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"We support the initiative of the United States, including with respect to the UN Security Council draft resolution on Syria.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"I think Syrian officials will agree with the draft, too.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"This means that both the US and Europe are highly concerned with the current situation in the Middle East, Yemen, Syria and Iraq.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"Based on these democratic procedures, Syria will decide which form of government is the most suitable and who will lead the country.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"Of course, it is a complicated objective and of course there are various mutual grievances: some do not like this group and others do not like that group, some want to work with the Syrian Government and others refuse do so categorically.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,We said a long time ago that we will carry out air strikes to provide support for offensive operations by the Syrian army.,syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,And that is what we have been doing while the Syrian army conducts their operations.,syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"By the way, I have recently said publicly – the idea was proposed by Francois Hollande – that we should try to pool the forces of the Syrian army and at least part of the armed opposition in the fight against ISIS.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"This part of the Syrian opposition, these irreconcilable and armed people want to fight against ISIS and are actually doing so.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"We are supporting their fight against ISIS by delivering air strikes, just as we are doing to support the Syrian army.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"When we see that the process of rapprochement has begun and the Syrian army and Syrian authorities believe that the time has come to stop shooting and to start talking, this is when we will stop being more Syrian than Syrians themselves.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,There you go again about Syria.,syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,Some of the resources that we earmarked for military training and exercises – we simply retargeted them to the operations of our Aerospace Forces in Syria.,syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,We simply direct a part of the resources to the operation in Syria.,syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"We have both different and similar approaches to resolving the Syrian crisis, and we maintain contact with Saudi Arabia.",syria,[]
1776,2015-12-17 15:15:00,"As you may be aware, these submarines are equipped with the latest Kalibr missiles, which performed very well in Syria.",syria,[]
1777,2015-12-19 16:45:00,"The Russian Armed Forces are fighting militants at the forward defence lines, destroying their infrastructure, their camps and bases in Syria.",syria,[]
1777,2015-12-19 16:45:00,I have already mentioned Syria.,syria,[]
1788,2015-12-24 19:20:00,Our countries are in favour of a political settlement of the Syrian conflict and national accord in Afghanistan.,syria,[]
1800,2016-01-12 06:00:00,I think that President al-Assad has made many mistakes in the course of the Syrian conflict.,syria,[]
1800,2016-01-12 06:00:00,Regarding your question if al-Assad is an ally or not and our goals in Syria.,syria,[]
1800,2016-01-12 06:00:00,I can tell you precisely what we do not want to happen: we do not want the Libyan or Iraqi scenario to be repeated in Syria.,syria,[]
1800,2016-01-12 06:00:00,That also applies to Syria.,syria,[]
1800,2016-01-12 06:00:00,"As far as Syria is concerned, I think that we should work towards a constitutional reform.",syria,[]
1800,2016-01-12 06:00:00,It is the Syrian people themselves who must decide who and how should run their country.,syria,[]
1800,2016-01-12 06:00:00,"First, the Syrian people should be given the opportunity to have their say.",syria,[]
1800,2016-01-12 06:00:00,"It hampers the efforts to settle the Syrian crisis and the fight against terrorism, as well as the process of halting the inflow of refugees to Europe, that much is certain.",syria,[]
1816,2016-01-25 16:30:00,"You know, we are not going to meddle in any way in the state structure, in resolving problems standing before Syria or other nations in the region, which you just mentioned.",syria,[]
1816,2016-01-25 16:30:00,"Our objective is only to help your people, the legitimate leadership of your country – in this case Syria – to fight terrorism, to eliminate terrorism on Syrian soil.",syria,[]
1842,2016-02-17 17:45:00,"We think that to solve the refugee problem, we first need to achieve political settlement of the conflicts in Syria, Libya and other countries where war and chaos have forced people to flee their homes.",syria,[]
1847,2016-02-20 19:00:00,The military skills of our servicemen are being perfected now in the combat operation in Syria.,syria,[]
1847,2016-02-20 19:00:00,"In complicated conditions they are helping the Syrian government army and other participants in the anti-terrorist struggle to rout militants, to save peaceful citizens from violence, barbarity and outrage.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,"During our conversation, we approved joint statements of Russia and the US, as co-chairs of the ISSG, on the cessation of hostilities in Syria.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,We also made use of the positive experience we accumulated over the course of cooperation in eliminating chemical weapons in Syria.,syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,"It was agreed that the cessation of hostilities in Syria commences at 00:00 (Damascus time) on February 27, 2016 on terms and conditions that are a part of the Russian-American statement.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,"The essence of these conditions is as follows: by 12:00 pm on February 26, 2016, all parties warring in Syria must indicate to the Russian Federation or our American partners their commitment to the cessation of hostilities.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,"No military action will be taken against them by the Armed Forces of the Syrian Arab Republic, Russian Armed Forces and the US-led coalition.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,"In turn, the opposition will cease all military action against the Armed Forces of the Syrian Arab Republic and other groups supporting them.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,"It is fundamentally important that Russia and the US, as co-chairs of the ISSG, are prepared to launch effective mechanisms to promote and monitor compliance with the ceasefire by both the Syrian Government and the armed opposition groups.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,Russia will conduct the necessary work with Damascus and the legitimate Syrian leadership.,syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,I am sure that the joint actions agreed upon with the American side will be enough to radically reverse the crisis situation in Syria.,syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,"As a result, humanitarian access to all Syrian citizens in need should be made easier.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,"Most important is the creation of conditions for launching a long-term political process through a broad inter-Syrian dialogue in Geneva, under the auspices of the UN.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,"Against this background, Russian-American agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Syria, and their joint implementation in coordination with all nations participating in the International Syria Support Group, can become an example of responsible actions the global community takes against the threat of terrorism, which are based on international law and UN principles.",syria,[]
1848,2016-02-22 21:50:00,I would like to hope that the Syrian leadership and all our partners in the region and beyond will support the set of actions chosen by representatives of Russia and the US.,syria,[]
1853,2016-02-26 14:00:00,"This includes the efforts of our colleagues working in military counterintelligence, ensuring, for example, the safety of our pilots carrying out counterterrorist operations in Syria and the anti-terrorist units working here inside Russia.",syria,[]
1853,2016-02-26 14:00:00,"To say a few more words about the Syrian issue, as you know, on February 22, Russia and the United States of America adopted a joint statement on cessation of hostilities in Syria.",syria,[]
1853,2016-02-26 14:00:00,"The purpose of this document is to give impetus to the efforts to resolve the Syrian conflict, more precisely, to boost the efforts to find a political solution and put in place the conditions for starting the settlement process.",syria,[]
1853,2016-02-26 14:00:00,We must put in place conditions for bringing a swift end to the bloodshed and then starting a full-fledged intra-Syrian dialogue with all constructive political forces taking part.,syria,[]
1853,2016-02-26 14:00:00,"On February 27, starting at midnight Damascus time, the Syrian armed forces, Russia, and the US-led coalition will not conduct hostilities against those armed groups that declare their readiness to observe the ceasefire.",syria,[]
1853,2016-02-26 14:00:00,"In this respect, Russia in general and its armed forces took timely action in starting our operations in Syria.",syria,[]
1853,2016-02-26 14:00:00,"In this respect, I want to add that this refugee crisis began long before Russia began its antiterrorist operation in Syria.",syria,[]
1853,2016-02-26 14:00:00,What have Russia’s operations in Syria got to do with them?,syria,[]
1872,2016-03-11 15:45:00,"Of course, our operations against the terrorists in Syria have also been a serious test for our new arms and equipment, especially our aviation equipment.",syria,[]
1874,2016-03-14 20:35:00,"Colleagues, I have invited you here so we can once again assess the situation concerning settlement of the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
1874,2016-03-14 20:35:00,I feel that the objectives set before the Defence Ministry and the Russian Armed Forces in the Syrian Arab Republic have generally been fulfilled.,syria,[]
1874,2016-03-14 20:35:00,"With participation by Russian troops and Russian military grouping, the Syrian troops and Syrian patriotic forces, we were able to radically change the situation in fighting international terrorism and take initiative in nearly all areas to create the conditions for the start of a peace process, as I said.",syria,[]
1874,2016-03-14 20:35:00,"I feel that the objective set before the Defence Ministry and the Armed Forces is generally fulfilled, so I order the Defence Ministry to begin withdrawing the main part of our military group from the Syrian Arab Republic beginning tomorrow.",syria,[]
1874,2016-03-14 20:35:00,I ask the Foreign Ministry to intensify the Russian Federation’s participation in organising the peace process to resolve Syria’s problems.,syria,[]
1874,2016-03-14 20:35:00,"This part of our military group was located in Syria over the course of many previous years, and today, it must continue to fulfil the highly important function of monitoring the ceasefire and creating conditions for the peace process.",syria,[]
1874,2016-03-14 20:35:00,I hope that this will significantly lift the level of trust between all participants in the Syrian peace process and promote resolving the Syrian issue via peaceful means.,syria,[]
1879,2016-03-17 13:15:00,This is exactly how you acted during the military operation in Syria – like true Russian soldiers.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"Comrade officers, friends, I would like to welcome you – all the service personnel who took part in the operation in Syria.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"From the very start, we were very clear about its goals: support of the Syrian army in its lawful struggle with terrorist groups.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,We stated clearly that we did not intend to get involved in an internal Syrian conflict.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,Only the Syrians themselves should seek a final solution and decide their country’s future.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,I would like to repeat that the main goal of our actions in Syria was to stop the global evil and not to let terrorism spread to Russia.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,We have done a huge amount of work to support the lawful Syrian authorities – this is what I spoke about when addressing the United Nations on the organisation’s 70th anniversary.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,The Syrian army has gained the strategic initiative and continues clearing its land of terrorists.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"We have managed to achieve positive, constructive cooperation with the United States of America and a number of other countries, as well as with the responsible political forces within Syria that truly wish to stop the war and find the only possible political solution to the conflict.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"The decision to withdraw a significant part of our service personnel and equipment was coordinated with the President of Syria Bashar al-Assad, who was notified of our plans in advance and supported them.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"Meanwhile, the government troops in Syria will not conduct any action against the armed units of the Syrian opposition that indicated their commitment to a ceasefire.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"In this connection, I would like to specify the tasks our service personnel remaining in the Syrian Republic will be working on.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,I will repeat that the primary task is to monitor ceasefire and create conditions for a political internal dialogue in Syria.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"Our bases in Syria are at Tartus and Khmeimim, the service personnel there are reliably protected from land, sea and air.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,I would like to note that we have significantly restored the potential of the Syrian air defence forces as well.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"We proceed from fundamental international norms – nobody has the right to violate the airspace of a sovereign country, Syria in this case.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,We will of course continue to provide assistance to the lawful Syrian government.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"This assistance is comprehensive in nature and includes financial aid, supplies of equipment and arms, assistance in training and building Syrian armed forces, reconnaissance support and assistance to headquarters in planning operations.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,The Russian forces that remain in Syria are enough to ensure this.,syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"We will continue to assist the Syrian army and authorities in their fight against the so-called Islamic State, Jabhat al-Nusra and other terrorist groups that have been declared as such, as I have said, by the UN Security Council.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"Moreover, I am certain that with our support and strengthening of the Syrian army, we will shortly see the patriotic forces there achieve success in their struggle against terrorism.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"I hope this treasure of the world civilisation, or whatever is left of it after the bandits got there, would be returned to the people of Syria and the whole world.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"Therefore, we still count on the common sense of both sides, on the adherence by both the Syrian authorities and the opposition to a peaceful process.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"The very fact that we withdrew part of our military group there against the backdrop of negotiations on the Syrian settlement that started in Geneva is an important positive signal, and I am certain that all parties to the Syrian conflict will duly appreciate it.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"We will work and make every effort in coordination with our partners to help establish peace in Syria, to rid the long-suffering people of Syria of the terrorist threat and help the Syrians restore their country.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"And finally, over the short period in Syria, as I have said, we deployed a modern and efficient air defence system and developed cooperation between all the forces and resources and organised administrative support for the group.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"The military operation in Syria certainly required certain funds, however the main part of the funding came from the Defence Ministry, their resources.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"We simply retargeted these funds to support our group in Syria, and there is hardly a better way of training and perfecting combat skills than under real combat conditions.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"Obviously, additional funds will be required to restock our arsenals, equipment and ammunition, including repairs of the equipment that was used in Syria.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,"Comrade officers, The large-scale operation in Syria went on for more than 5 months in a complicated region, far from Russia, and you have done your duty with honour by protecting the security of your country and your people at faraway frontiers.",syria,[]
1880,2016-03-17 13:45:00,I thank all the participants of the military operation in Syria.,syria,[]
1885,2016-03-22 18:40:00,"We talked in detail about global crises, including the situation in Syria.",syria,[]
1885,2016-03-22 18:40:00,"We also talked about international relations, and the ideas and thoughts Mr Putin expressed are very important – thoughts and ideas on the situation in the Middle East and Syria.",syria,[]
1885,2016-03-22 18:40:00,Our common desire is to continue the ceasefire in Syria and the political process with participation by Russia and the United States.,syria,[]
1891,2016-03-24 19:40:00,"Mr Secretary of State, we understand that what we have managed to achieve on the Syrian track has only been possible thanks to the position of the political leadership of the United States, the position of President Obama.",syria,[]
1891,2016-03-24 19:40:00,"I very much hope that your visit will allow us to harmonise our positions as regards further settlement both in Syria and, as you said, in Ukraine. <…>",syria,[]
1898,2016-03-29 17:50:00,"Before we start discussing the issues on our agenda, I would like to revisit a well-known issue – the liberation of the Syrian city of Palmyra by the Syrian Army with our most active support and participation.",syria,[]
1898,2016-03-29 17:50:00,"In a telephone conversation with the Director-General of UNESCO and then with the President of Syria, we agreed that Russia will provide assistance in clearing Palmyra, approach routes to Palmyra, and, what is especially important, the historical sites, of mines.",syria,[]
1907,2016-04-06 14:00:00,"Now I am happy to have this chance to exchange views with you and your high-level delegation on international affairs, probably the sanctions, the situation in Syria, and the matters that you mentioned.",syria,[]
1908,2016-04-06 17:00:00,Dealing with the issue of extremism is a major condition for a stable political settlement in Syria and for stopping the flow of refugees to Europe from the Middle East.,syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,"It is still too early to talk about a fundamental turnaround in Syria, but it is clear that we have carried out our mission with success.",syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,Our mission was above all to bolster Syria’s statehood and support the legitimate government.,syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,"We need to support and strengthen statehood in the countries where it still exists, and here, I am referring to Syria.",syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,Syria’s statehood has been strengthened.,syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,"Note that after the bulk of our forces withdrew, Syria’s government forces continued their active offensive and, with our support, are liberating more and more towns.",syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,"First, they spoke of the need to isolate Russia following the events in Crimea, for example; then it became clear that this would not be possible, and with the start of the operations in Syria, it became absolutely clear that this kind of destructive action against our country is simply not possible.",syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,Your colleague from Dagestan already started with Syria.,syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,"However, in fact, we should have started not with Syria, but with the early 1990s.",syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,The recent events in Syria showed Russia’s ability to deal with problems not only near our borders but also far from them.,syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,"The capabilities of our armed forces have increased immeasurably, as is evidenced by the Syria case.",syria,[]
1909,2016-04-07 17:00:00,"So if we (as we can establish a constructive dialogue in certain other areas, say, in fighting terrorism in Syria) manage to carry on this work, extremely important not only for the United States and Russia but as well as, without any exaggeration, for the entire world, we will, of course, not only be ready for this work; we are ready for it now; we want to continue it and we will see it through to the end, but on an equal basis. <…> (answering a question about Crimea’s agro-industrial sector)",syria,[]
1915,2016-04-14 15:40:00,"But in Syria, it is not a case of that we simply got up and left, abandoning everything.",syria,[]
1915,2016-04-14 15:40:00,"Let me note that we did indeed withdraw a substantial portion of our forces, but we made sure that after our withdrawal, the Syrian army would be in a fit state to carry out serious offensives itself, with our remaining forces’ support.",syria,[]
1915,2016-04-14 15:40:00,"And we see that after our withdrawal, the Syrian army took Palmyra and a number of other important strategic towns.",syria,[]
1915,2016-04-14 15:40:00,Aleppo is a strategically important region in Syria.,syria,[]
1915,2016-04-14 15:40:00,"The Syrian army does not have to try to bolster its position, because it achieved what it wanted before the ceasefire was announced, with our help, and does not have to make such attempts now, but the opposition is trying to take back what it lost.",syria,[]
1915,2016-04-14 15:40:00,"Incidentally, it is not the Syrian army that is fighting there, but for the most part it is Kurdish groups and a few other armed groups.",syria,[]
1915,2016-04-14 15:40:00,"Today there are also examples of such cooperation, relating to issues of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the fight against terrorism, the resolution, say, of Iran’s nuclear problem, chemical weapons in Syria and the fight against terror in general.",syria,[]
1915,2016-04-14 15:40:00,"The interest in our weapons, especially (as you rightly pointed out) after or during the operation of our Aerospace Forces, and generally our Armed Forces in Syria, has sharply increased.",syria,[]

1915,2016-04-14 15:40:00,"However, I would like to call your attention to the fairly positive turn which we have given the job of late: we are working together fairly intensively through the military, secret services and foreign ministries to find the way to settle the Syria conflict.",syria,[]

2017,2016-06-17 16:20:00,"I think that the problems of Syria, of course, concern primarily the anti-terrorist struggle, but there is more to it.",syria,[]
2017,2016-06-17 16:20:00,"It goes without saying that the Syrian conflict is rooted in contradictions within Syrian society, and President Bashar al-Assad understands this very well.",syria,[]

2045,2016-06-30 14:10:00,"It is in Syria that the fight against terrorism is being decided, the fight against this same Islamic State that has gathered terrorists and extremists of all stripes under its banners and united them in a desire to expand throughout the entire Muslim world.",syria,[]
2045,2016-06-30 14:10:00,This is why we responded last autumn to the Syrian government’s request for help in fighting this terrorist attack.,syria,[]

2045,2016-06-30 14:10:00,"Certainly, we know that we are still a very long way from reaching a final settlement, but the experience we have gained over these past months in Syria shows very clearly that, as I said, only through common efforts and working towards the broad anti-terrorist front that Russia has consistently called for can we successfully counter today’s threats, combat terrorism and resolve the other challenges humanity faces today.",syria,[]
2083,2016-08-09 18:00:00,"By the way, we agreed that following the news conference we will have a separate discussion of all issues related to the Syrian settlement.",syria,[]

2083,2016-08-09 18:00:00,How much did you focus on Syria today?,syria,[]
2083,2016-08-09 18:00:00,"I would like to say that we do not deal with exchanges and ransom, but indeed, several months ago the United States asked us to help secure the release of an American citizen who wound up on the territory of the Syrian Republic.",syria,[]
2083,2016-08-09 18:00:00,"We simply reached an agreement with the Syrian authorities on this issue, received the man and transferred him to the US – of course, without any money or ransom.",syria,[]
2119,2016-09-04 18:20:00,"Also, I think we should discuss the situations in Syria and Ukraine, since we are all involved in addressing these problems.",syria,[]
2119,2016-09-04 18:20:00,"As for Syria, here we need to move towards full-fledged dialogue.",syria,[]
2121,2016-09-05 10:30:00,"If we load it with… Of course, politics affects economic processes, this is obvious, but if we bring some squabbles, or not squabbles, rather, some matters that are really important but relate purely to world politics, we will overload the G20 agenda and instead of addressing such issues as finance, structural economic reforms, tax evasion and so forth, we will engage in endless debates concerning the Syrian crisis or some other global challenges, of which there are many, or the Middle East problem.",syria,[]
2121,2016-09-05 10:30:00,"Apart from other things, though, as I have already said, we share the objective of reaching an agreement on the regional challenges, including the Syrian problem.",syria,[]
2121,2016-09-05 10:30:00,Same thing with Syria.,syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,"We cannot be 100 percent certain, but we are continuing our dialogue on these matters, on Syria, with our Turkish partners and with our American partners.",syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,"Second, for all the difficulties, we nonetheless have moved closer in our positions and in our understanding of what we can do to defuse the situation in Syria and search for mutually acceptable decisions.",syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,"I don’t think I can say anything final right now because the US State Department and our Foreign Ministry are still finalising several preliminary agreements, but I think that we are on the right road and could reach an agreement for some period of time on what we can do together, and I emphasise this, by way of strenuous efforts to improve the situation in Syria.",syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,"Of course we would have to consult with the Syrian government and would have to keep our other partners informed, including Iran.",syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,"You could see it after all, the troop movements, the objectives, and the problems that Turkey has encountered in connection with events in Syria.",syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,The person who shot from Syrian territory at our pilots when they ejected has also been arrested.,syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,"As for the issues we really did discuss, the first was Syria and the possibilities for our cooperation in this area.",syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,"Both countries have an interest in fighting terrorism and we sense (I do, at any rate) the US President is also completely sincere in wanting to achieve results in fighting terrorism and resolving the Syrian conflict.",syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,"If [US Secretary of State John] Kerry and [Sergei] Lavrov can do this, we will have made another step forward in resolving the Syrian conflict.",syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,About Syria?,syria,[]
2124,2016-09-05 17:20:00,"Nevertheless, I very much hope that if agreements are reached – and I have reason to believe that this could happen within the next few days – then we will be able to say that our collaboration with the US in fighting terrorist organisations, including in Syria, will significantly improve and intensify.",syria,[]
2144,2016-09-17 12:15:00,I can tell you why: this has to do with the difficulties that the United States is facing on the Syrian track.,syria,[]
2144,2016-09-17 12:15:00,"Moreover, we have reached agreements with President Assad and the Syrian Government.",syria,[]
2144,2016-09-17 12:15:00,"As we see it, the Syrian forces are implementing these agreements in full.",syria,[]
2144,2016-09-17 12:15:00,"This is regrettable but I proceed from the notion that we share the determination to reach peace in Syria and the common task of fighting terrorism, international terrorism.",syria,[]
2144,2016-09-17 12:15:00,"However, we, of course, we will not be disclosing any details until our US partners consent to so, due to specific agreements, which are usually reached diplomatically when working with issues like the Syrian settlement.",syria,[]
2154,2016-09-21 20:00:00,There are complicated issues related to Syria and Ukraine.,syria,[]
2154,2016-09-21 20:00:00,"I would be grateful if we could discuss them, especially the most recent incidents, such as the attack on the humanitarian convoy in Syria.",syria,[]
2183,2016-10-10 20:20:00,"As the President of Turkey pointed out, we spent a great deal of time on regional issues today, primarily on the situation in Syria, naturally.",syria,[]
2183,2016-10-10 20:20:00,"I informed our   Turkish partner that we proposed to our US colleagues that we do everything in our power to withdraw Syrian troops and opposition forces from Castello Road which can and should be used to deliver humanitarian aid to Aleppo, so that provocations involving strikes on humanitarian convoys will not happen again.",syria,[]
2187,2016-10-12 16:30:00,"The French resolution blamed the situation entirely on the Syrian authorities and said nothing about the opposition – in this case I am not talking about terrorists – the opposition that should also bear some responsibility, and some tasks should also be put before it.",syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,"From the looks of things though, this is not the best moment for official meetings, given the lack of mutual understanding, to put it mildly, that we have over events in Syria, particularly the situation in Aleppo.",syria,['situation']
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,"But if the main reason for my visit to Paris is not appropriate, we will probably find another opportunity to meet and discuss Syria.",syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,I would say this is political rhetoric that does not have great significance and does not take into account the real situation in Syria.,syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,"I believe deeply that some of the responsibility for what is happening in the region in general and in Syria in particular lies especially with our Western partners, above all the USA and its allies, including the main European countries.",syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,Our goal is to prevent the same from happening in Syria.,syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,Let’s recall that the refugee problem began long before Russia started making efforts to normalise and stabilise the situation in Syria.,syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,The mass departure of people from huge swathes of the Middle East and from Africa and Afghanistan too began long before we started active operations in Syria.,syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,"On September 16, American aircraft launched a strike against Syrian army forces that killed 80 people.",syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,"There is only one road the convoys can take, with militants on one side of the road and the Syrian army on the other side.",syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,"We have suggested that the militants and the Syrian army both pull away from the road, providing safe transit for the humanitarian convoys.",syria,[]
2189,2016-10-12 21:15:00,"We should be busy not with political rhetoric, but with looking for solutions to the situation, including in Syria.",syria,[]
2190,2016-10-13 09:40:00,"We take similar stances on urgent international issues, including the Syrian crisis and the Middle East settlement.",syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"However, the circumstances surrounding the Syrian problem for some reason made France decide that part was now impractical as a joint activity.",syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"We have issues beside Syria, so it would have been possible to discuss other issues.",syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"Also, France is not as deeply involved in the Syrian peace process.",syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"At one point the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier reached the shores of Syria, and we agreed to work together to an extent, but after a couple of days, the ship turned around and headed for the Suez Canal.",syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"I would like to repeat, although France is part of the Friends of Syria Group, it is not as deeply involved in Syrian issues.",syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,And all of us believe that there is no other solution to the Syrian problem other than a diplomatic one.,syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"In this context, I have informed all of our colleagues and friends in this five-member group about our view on the situation in Syria and, in particular, around Aleppo.",syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"In general, regarding sanctions against Russia, no matter whether introduced over developments in southeastern Ukraine or in Syria, I can tell you that the goal of those who formulate and advocate this policy is not to settle a specific problem, for example, in southeastern Ukraine, but to contain Russia.",syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,Are you sure our relations with the US deteriorated because of Syria?,syria,[]
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"No, not because of Syria but because of attempts by one country to impose its decisions on the entire world.",syria,[]
2202,2016-10-20 02:20:00,"The second matter, discussed with our European – German and French – colleagues dealt with the situation around Syria and Syrian settlement in general.",syria,[]
2202,2016-10-20 02:20:00,"I informed our European partners of our view on the developments there and on what needs to be done immediately to fight terrorism, to root out terrorism on Syrian soil, to make sure this hotbed does not flare up again in the future, and, of course, what should be done to ensure that our efforts lead to a final settlement.",syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,We see this in the way events in Syria are developing.,syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,And then came Syria.,syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,The same is happening in Syria.,syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"But let’s remember that as soon as the conflict began in Syria, and it began long before we became involved, terrorists appeared there and began receiving arms supplies.",syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"There are many issues it has become difficult to discuss with the current administration because practically no obligations are met and no agreements are respected, including those on Syria.",syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,We already hear the talk about refugees and Syria.,syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,What has Syria got to do with this?,syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"There was indeed talk on the lines that Russian and Syrian aircraft would cease their airstrikes against terrorist targets in Aleppo until the healthy opposition forces could be separated from the forces of Jabhat al-Nusra, a terrorist organisation recognised as such by the United Nations and included on the list of international terrorist organisations.",syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"The ceasefire was declared on September 12, I think, and on the 17th, American aircraft carried out a strike against Syrian troops, and this was followed by an ISIS offensive.",syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,I think this should be done openly and honestly and not simply in an attempt to use this to influence our position on Syria.,syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"By the way, do you realise that Russian and Syrian aircraft have not been carrying out any operations around Aleppo for 9 days now.",syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"But I think, as I have already said, that even if these problems linked with Ukraine, its south-east, Crimea and Syria had not existed, something else would have been found to deter Russia.",syria,[]
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"Our American partners did not do something on the Syrian issue (they even feel embarrassed for not doing it, for not using the agreements), and they send the Europeans to exert pressure on us on the other side.",syria,[]
2222,2016-11-03 19:50:00,A Syrian hospital?,syria,[]
2229,2016-11-09 13:30:00,"These are our guiding principles as we decide our approaches to the most pressing issues on today’s agenda, including the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
2229,2016-11-09 13:30:00,"Syria is essentially a test today for the international community’s ability and readiness to join forces, together take a stand against terrorism, a common threat for us all, and find adequate responses to other global challenges to security and stability.",syria,[]
2229,2016-11-09 13:30:00,Russia will work together with other interested countries to facilitate the launch of dialogue between the Syrians themselves.,syria,[]
2240,2016-11-15 14:30:00,"Colleagues,  During our meetings, we have repeatedly discussed and will discuss again Russia’s military operation against terrorists in Syria.",syria,[]
2242,2016-11-16 14:30:00,The experience gained during the military operations against international terrorists in Syria should be systematically put into practice in training and preparation work at the service personnel and command levels.,syria,[]
2263,2016-12-01 13:10:00,That is the task our servicemen are fulfilling in Syria.,syria,[]
2275,2016-12-07 14:00:00,The military operation against the terrorists in Syria is convincing evidence of our armed forces’ growing potential.,syria,[]
2275,2016-12-07 14:00:00,"Risking their lives, our service personnel are doing all they can to help the Syrian army to fight terrorism in order to save civilian lives.",syria,[]

2282,2016-12-09 12:20:00,We will not forget how our defenders fearlessly risk their lives to fulfill their military duty in Syria.,syria,[]
2284,2016-12-12 16:10:00,"We all know examples such as Syria, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan.",syria,[]
2285,2016-12-13 11:00:00,Due to the events in Ukraine or in Syria?,syria,[]
2285,2016-12-13 11:00:00,"However, Japan and Russian-Japanese relations are hardly related to the events in Syria or in Ukraine.",syria,[]
2285,2016-12-13 11:00:00,"Here is an example: while resolving current issues, our American colleagues made a proposal on the Syrian settlement but then suddenly declared at the UN that they were not going to discuss anything with us.",syria,[]
2289,2016-12-16 10:45:00,"Regarding the situation in Syria, I will answer question by question.",syria,[]
2289,2016-12-16 10:45:00,"Everything going on around Palmyra is a result of poorly coordinated action by the so-called international coalition, the Syrian officials and Russia.",syria,[]
2289,2016-12-16 10:45:00,"Second, this happened after our most recent talks, and I do hope that, after a definitely successful operation in Aleppo, the Syrian army will be able to hold its positions there and the civilians will be able come back to their normal life.",syria,[]
2289,2016-12-16 10:45:00,"That is, we will propose to the Syrian government and the President of Turkey will propose to the armed opposition.",syria,[]
2289,2016-12-16 10:45:00,This is how I see Syria’s prospects.,syria,[]
2294,2016-12-19 22:45:00,"This crime is undeniably a provocation aimed at derailing the normalisation of Russian-Turkish relations and the peace process in Syria, which is actively promoted by Russia, Turkey, Iran and other countries interested in the settlement of the internal conflict in Syria.",syria,[]
2297,2016-12-22 13:30:00,The Russian Armed Forces have passed the test of counterterrorist struggle in Syria.,syria,[]
2297,2016-12-22 13:30:00,"Thanks to their substantial support, the Syrian Army has held several successful operations against the terrorists.",syria,[]
2297,2016-12-22 13:30:00,Our Armed Forces also provide major humanitarian assistance to Syrians.,syria,[]
2297,2016-12-22 13:30:00,I would like to once again express my gratitude to our military leaders and personnel involved in the Syrian operation for their professionalism and courage.,syria,[]
2297,2016-12-22 13:30:00,"Finally, Russian weapons proved their effectiveness in Syria, which offers new possibilities in terms of promoting military technical cooperation.",syria,[]
2298,2016-12-23 11:40:00,"Mr Shoigu, I know that the operation to liberate Aleppo, this city of crucial importance for Syria, has ended.",syria,[]
2298,2016-12-23 11:40:00,"This stage made it possible for us, together with our Turkish and Iranian colleagues and our colleagues from the Syrian authorities, of course, to organise the departure from the city of nearly 34,000 people over these days.",syria,[]
2298,2016-12-23 11:40:00,"In our opinion, we are close to reaching an agreement on a complete ceasefire across Syria.",syria,[]
2298,2016-12-23 11:40:00,Our specialists are working with their Syrian colleagues.,syria,[]
2298,2016-12-23 11:40:00,"Mr Shoigu, we are well aware that liberating Aleppo from radical groups is an important part of the efforts to fully normalise the situation in Syria, and hopefully, in the region in general.",syria,[]
2298,2016-12-23 11:40:00,"Together with our partners from Iran and Turkey, and of course with the Syrian government, other countries in the region and all countries concerned, we will need to continue efforts to achieve a final settlement.",syria,[]
2298,2016-12-23 11:40:00,"We must make the greatest effort now to end hostilities everywhere in Syria, and we will, at least, do our sincerest best to achieve this goal.",syria,[]
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"Needless to say, this would not have been achieved without the goodwill and efforts of Mr Assad, the President of the Syrian Arab Republic, and his staff.",syria,[]
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"The next step, while we are at it, should be an agreement on a ceasefire throughout Syria, immediately followed by practical talks on political reconciliation.",syria,[]
2303,2016-12-26 17:10:00,"The problems in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Syria and other hot spots are all subjects of concern.",syria,[]
2310,2016-12-29 14:20:00,The first is an agreement between the Syrian government and the armed opposition on a ceasefire on the Syrian Arab Republic’s territory.,syria,[]
2310,2016-12-29 14:20:00,The third document is a statement of readiness to start peace talks on ending the Syrian conflict.,syria,[]
2310,2016-12-29 14:20:00,"We know that the Russian, Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers recently held a trilateral meeting in Moscow, at which all three countries committed themselves to not simply monitoring but also guaranteeing the peace process in Syria.",syria,[]
2310,2016-12-29 14:20:00,"In this respect, I call on the Syrian Arab Republic’s government, the armed opposition groups, and all countries in the region, whether involved in the conflict or with influence on the parties to the conflict, to give their support to the agreements reached and take an active part in the planned talks in Kazakhstan’s capital.",syria,[]
2310,2016-12-29 14:20:00,I agree with the Defence Ministry proposal to scale back our military presence in Syria.,syria,[]
2310,2016-12-29 14:20:00,"We will certainly continue our fight against international terrorism, of course, and will continue to support the legitimate Syrian government in its fight against terrorism.",syria,[]
2334,2017-01-25 18:15:00,"In the course of your visit today we will certainly talk about bilateral relations and the situation in the region, naturally, with a focus on sore spots, including efforts to reach a settlement in Syria.",syria,[]
2334,2017-01-25 18:15:00,I consider it very important to note that the participants in the Astana process have declared that it is impossible to resolve the Syrian problem by military means.,syria,[]
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"I briefed our colleagues in detail on our view regarding events in eastern Ukraine, and in the Middle East, including in Syria.",syria,[]
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"Political settlement in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries, and the entire region’s return to normal life as soon as possible, would certainly help to ease the serious migration crisis in Europe in general.",syria,[]
2366,2017-02-23 16:30:00,"And this undoubtedly contributed to the positive results of the efforts of all countries involved in combating international terrorism, in this case in the Syrian Arab Republic, and facilitated creating conditions for the continuation of peace talks between Syria’s government and the armed opposition.",syria,[]
2366,2017-02-23 16:30:00,"But for us it is no less important, perhaps even more important, that, unfortunately, in Syria, a huge number of militants have amassed, who have come from the republics of the former Soviet Union and from Russia itself.",syria,[]
2366,2017-02-23 16:30:00,"Considering that we have a visa-free travel regime with practically all former Soviet countries, we are aware of the enormous danger for us, for Russia, lurking in this terrorist breeding ground in Syria.",syria,[]
2366,2017-02-23 16:30:00,"Primarily, we believe in the need to preserve Syria’s territorial integrity.",syria,[]
2366,2017-02-23 16:30:00,"We know Syria as a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and secular state.",syria,[]
2366,2017-02-23 16:30:00,"At the end of the day, however, it is up to the Syrian people to decide.",syria,[]
2366,2017-02-23 16:30:00,"We have every right to view the first successful talks in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana, between representatives of the armed opposition and the Syrian Government with the participation of Russia, Iran, Turkey and Jordan as a result of these efforts, including your work.",syria,[]
2366,2017-02-23 16:30:00,"That said, the sooner the country launches a political settlement, the more chances there will be for the international community and you and me to overcome the terrorist contagion in Syria.",syria,[]
2366,2017-02-23 16:30:00,"We will not, we should not and are not seeking to interfere in Syria’s domestic affairs.",syria,[]
2368,2017-02-23 18:00:00,"I would like to thank all the service members who are currently helping the people of Syria in their fight against terrorism, for their bravery and resolve.",syria,[]
2369,2017-02-27 11:00:00,I would like to start this meeting by expressing our gratitude for your efforts to organise the inter-Syrian talks in Astana.,syria,[]
2375,2017-02-28 14:50:00,"With regard to Syria, we cannot but be pleased that the Astana process was very positive through to the end.",syria,[]
2375,2017-02-28 14:50:00,"With regard to the sanctions, I think it is totally inappropriate in relation to the Syrian leadership because it would not help the negotiation process, and instead would damage or undermine trust during the negotiation process.",syria,[]
2375,2017-02-28 14:50:00,Russia will not support any new sanctions on Syria.,syria,[]
2386,2017-03-10 14:15:00,"We are working energetically to settle the most acute crises in the world, primarily in Syria.",syria,[]
2387,2017-03-10 19:30:00,"In our official statements, I believe we can dispense with the phrase “normalisation of relations” because we believe we have already passed this stage on issues such as Syria and regional security.",syria,[]
2387,2017-03-10 19:30:00,"On regional security, I believe we should work together to stop the bloodshed in Syria and put an end to that situation.",syria,[]
2387,2017-03-10 19:30:00,"Our services, which are responsible for freeing northern Syria of terrorist elements, are doing a very important job, working intensively.",syria,['northern']
2387,2017-03-10 19:30:00,"As for the activity of Syrian groups affiliated with the PKK terrorist organisation, such and PYD and YPG, I believe it is necessary to completely put an end to their activity in Russia.",syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"While discussing topical international issues, considerable attention was given to the situation in the Middle East, in particular Syria.",syria,['particular']
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"They noted that largely thanks to the active role of Russia and Turkey, it became possible not only to ensure the cessation of hostilities between Syrian government forces and the armed opposition but also to begin substantive talks, direct and concrete negotiations between the parties to the conflict in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.",syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"The ceasefire in Syria is generally holding thanks to the well-coordinated efforts of Russia, Turkey and Iran.",syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"We discussed Syria, cooperation as part of the Organisation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, formation of a trilateral mechanism for consultations between Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkey, and the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh.",syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"We once again raised the issue that Turkey, which shares a 911-kilometre long border with Syria, has for six years suffered from the threats generated by the conflict in that country.",syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"An area equalling some 2,200 square kilometres in Syria was totally cleared of terrorists.",syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,I would like to underscore the issue of providing humanitarian aid to Syria’s population.,syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,I am certain that cooperation between Russia and Turkey in this area will help to ease the suffering of many Syrians.,syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,I can say that the Astana talks supplemented and supported the Geneva process of a Syrian conflict settlement and proved successful.,syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"Without doubt, a successful completion of talks in Geneva requires a serious approach from all parties, first and foremost from the Syrian regime.",syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,Syria’s territorial integrity and national unity must not be jeopardised.,syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,We will continue to search for a just resolution of the Syrian conflict in cooperation with Russia.,syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,A question on Syria.,syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"We know how complex the situation in the region is, not only in Syria but also in other countries.",syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"As for the prospects, frankly, the situation remains complicated; there are a lot of factors of uncertainty and there are a lot of disagreements in the region and the country we are now talking about, Syria.",syria,[]
2388,2017-03-10 19:40:00,"Needless to say, for peace and calm to hold in the region and to ensure the restoration of Syria and other countries in the region, the principle of territorial integrity should be observed, and in this sense, the restoration of Syria’s territorial integrity is, in our view, in my view, an indispensable condition for a full-scale settlement in that country.",syria,[]
2393,2017-03-15 16:00:00,"In October 2016, and in February this year, Russian air force planes delivered humanitarian aid from Armenia to Syria.",syria,[]
2393,2017-03-15 16:00:00,"We also discussed key international regional issues such as fighting terrorism, the situation in the Middle East, and the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
2393,2017-03-15 16:00:00,Let me take this opportunity to thank Russia for its help in transporting Armenian humanitarian aid to the Syrian people.,syria,[]
2397,2017-03-16 14:00:00,We outlined further plans regarding the fight against terrorism in Syria and a political solution to the conflict there.,syria,[]
2397,2017-03-16 14:00:00,Energetic efforts by Russia and Turkey were very instrumental in bringing about a ceasefire between the Syrian government forces and the armed opposition.,syria,[]
2397,2017-03-16 14:00:00,This made it possible to organise the peace negotiations on Syria in Astana.,syria,[]
2397,2017-03-16 14:00:00,We value greatly Kazakhstan’s contribution to organising and hosting the negotiations on Syria in Astana.,syria,[]
2406,2017-03-22 17:30:00,Russia’s arms are showing just how reliable and effective they are in the fight against terrorism in the Syrian Arab Republic and throughout the Middle East.,syria,[]
2407,2017-03-23 14:00:00,Present here today are senior officers taking part in the Russian Armed Forces’ operation against terrorists in Syria.,syria,[]
2407,2017-03-23 14:00:00,These systems have proved their worth in full measure during the anti-terrorist operations in Syria.,syria,[]
2410,2017-03-24 14:00:00,Russia is fighting in Syria.,syria,[]
2410,2017-03-24 14:00:00,"Tragic events are taking place in Syria and in Iraq’s Mosul, where hundreds of thousands of refugees were forced to flee from their homes.",syria,[]
2415,2017-03-28 17:40:00,Russia and Iran coordinate their efforts as we try to eliminate ISIS and al-Nusra and to settle the situation in Syria.,syria,[]
2415,2017-03-28 17:40:00,"Largely due to our joint efforts, we have succeeded in achieving the cessation of hostilities and extending this to a significant portion of Syria.",syria,[]
2415,2017-03-28 17:40:00,"The participation of Russia and Iran, along with Turkey, as guarantor countries in the Astana talks between the representatives of the armed opposition and the Syrian government is an important contribution to advancing a peaceful political settlement in Syria, and facilitating inter-Syrian talks and the corresponding process under the UN auspices in Geneva.",syria,[]
2415,2017-03-28 17:40:00,"We discussed the concerns that exist with regard to Syria and Yemen, and other countries of the region, as well as our cooperation in fighting terrorism.",syria,[]
2415,2017-03-28 17:40:00,"The talks in Astana with the participation of Iran, Russia and Turkey will also continue, so that the people of Syria can exercise their national rights.",syria,[]
2419,2017-03-30 15:40:00,"They would rather see Russia too busy with issues on its borders with its neighbours to be able to stick its nose into international issues such as Syria, the Middle East and others.",syria,[]
2419,2017-03-30 15:40:00,"By the way, our cooperation on some sensitive issues, such as cooperation in Syria, is improving and growing deeper and broader, despite any public statements.",syria,[]
2435,2017-04-11 15:45:00,"In this context, we also discussed ways to restore peace in the Middle East, including Syria.",syria,[]
2435,2017-04-11 15:45:00,"Regarding Syria, the tragic events of the previous week demonstrate that we must work together to find a solution to the crisis as soon as possible, based on dialogue at different levels, between the Syrian parties, regional participants and representatives of the international community.",syria,[]
2435,2017-04-11 15:45:00,"Syria and Russia, as a common enemy, provide a wonderful platform for consolidation.",syria,[]
2435,2017-04-11 15:45:00,"We have information from a variety of sources that such provocations (I cannot find another word for this) are being prepared in other parts of Syria, including in southern suburbs of Damascus, where they are planning to plant certain substances and accuse Syrian authorities of using them.",syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,Our contingent in Syria pursues precisely this goal.,syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,"Secondly, you are right in that, according to various estimates, around 20,000 foreign militants are fighting in Syria, and nearly 10,000 of them come from the CIS countries.",syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,We all witnessed the recent US airstrikes against Syria.,syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,Where is the proof that the Syrian government forces used chemical weapons?,syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,"Moreover, everyone knows very well that a major project was completed at the Russian and US initiative to liquidate the chemical weapons in the possession of the Syrian authorities.",syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,"If our partners say that peaceful civilians were injured in the Syrian air strike, these peaceful civilians should allow UN and other international observers to inspect the sites that were hit in the attack.",syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,The first is that the Syrian bombs hit a secret chemical weapons facility.,syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,"This means that the terrorists have these weapons, so why can’t they have them in Syria?",syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,"According to the second version, it was a staged provocation, a deliberate incident designed to create a pretext for increasing pressure on the legitimate Syrian authorities.",syria,[]
2436,2017-04-12 12:00:00,We believe that no move should be made against the Syrian authorities otherwise.,syria,[]
2449,2017-04-20 14:30:00,"In particular, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to learn about our journalists’ work in Syria.",syria,[]
2453,2017-04-25 15:50:00,"This is also taking place due to the effective use of our armaments in real, combat conditions, including in the anti-terrorism operation in Syria.",syria,[]
2463,2017-04-27 18:00:00,"The world is faced with challenging issues such as the situation in Syria and the fight against terrorism, which cannot be resolved without Russia’s constructive role.",syria,[]
2471,2017-05-02 16:15:00,"I am referring to Ukraine, Syria, and perhaps other regions.",syria,[]
2471,2017-05-02 16:15:00,"We will also talk about international affairs: the situations in Ukraine, Syria, and Libya.",syria,[]
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Federal Chancellor for coming to Sochi and for the opportunity to have a meaningful conversation on preparations for the upcoming July G20 meeting in Hamburg, and review urgent matters on the bilateral agenda, as well as exchange views on current international issues, including the Syria crisis and the situation in Ukraine.",syria,[]
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,We also exchanged opinions on the current situation in Syria and spoke for energising the negotiations within the Astana and Geneva formats.,syria,[]
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,We believe that a solution to the Syrian issue can only be found by peaceful means and under the aegis of the United Nations.,syria,[]
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"Those guilty of killing Syrian civilians must be found and punished, no question about that.",syria,[]
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,We also spoke about the situation in Syria.,syria,[]
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"Finally, Syria.",syria,[]
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,President al-Assad is mostly influenced by the Syrian people.,syria,[]
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,The people are quite obviously divided and we are seeing big problems within Syrian society.,syria,[]
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"In fact, our representatives in Astana will work on this tomorrow and the day after tomorrow together with the Syrian parties to the conflict.",syria,[]
2474,2017-05-03 17:10:00,"It is excellent that we have this opportunity to have this working meeting and discuss the key bilateral issues and go over the main problems on the international agenda, including such serious matters as the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"We discussed in detail the situation in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, of course.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,Mr Erdogan and I both share the same view that only political and diplomatic means can bring a solution to the Syrian conflict.,syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"I remind you that it was in large part thanks to the active efforts of Russia, Turkey and Iran that we not only achieved a ceasefire between Syrian government forces and the armed opposition, but got them to sit down at the negotiating table in Astana, where a fourth round of consultations is beginning today.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"During our meeting today, Mr Putin and I discussed regional issues, primarily, the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"“ True, for both our countries, Syria has been a deep bleeding wound over the past six years.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"At a time when children in other countries are playing and enjoying the arrival of spring and sunny days, Syrian children face death every day.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,The length of our border with Syria is 911 kilometres.,syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"We have provided shelter to about 3 million Syrian refugees in our country, who are doing their best to survive.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"Of course, we will talk about Syria, and we will hold meetings to overcome this crisis.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,I have no doubt that only a political process can settle the Syrian crisis and end the bloodshed there.,syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,Syria’s territorial integrity and political integrity are our priority.,syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"As long as Syria remains the stage for proxy war, terrorist organisations will continue to flourish.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"In this context, the fight against all terrorist organisations in Syria is crucial for the country’s future, for its people’s survival, and for peace in the world.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,Question (retranslated): I have a question about resolving the Syrian crisis and creating safe zones in Syria.,syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,The President and I operate on the premise – I already mentioned this – that the Syrian crisis can be resolved exclusively by political means.,syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"Regardless of the views that certain political forces may profess today, they must unite in the interest of the Syrian people.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"It is up to the Syrian people and the warring sides to decide on what grounds and platform, and in what ways they are going to do so.",syria,[]
2475,2017-05-03 17:40:00,"I believe it came up during the discussion of all these subtle issues with our partners in Turkey, Iran, and Syria itself.",syria,['itself']
2485,2017-05-11 17:45:00,"We appreciate Russia's counter-terrorism efforts, as well as its contribution to strengthening security and stability in the Middle East, including Syria.",syria,[]
2493,2017-05-15 13:20:00,"But the Kurds are a real factor in the situation in Syria and their fighters are taking part in operations against the so-called Islamic State and are among the most combat-ready groups; therefore, we think it perfectly justified to maintain working contacts with them, if only to avoid possible confrontation and situations that could pose a threat to our service personnel.",syria,[]
2493,2017-05-15 13:20:00,"Now, we will work on this at the military level and, at the meeting in Ankara (between Russia, Iran and Turkey), in constant consultation with the Syrians, of course, we will discuss the specific borders of these de-escalation zones, and discuss the verification issues: how, where, who and what will be monitored.",syria,[]
2495,2017-05-16 15:40:00,"I would also like to note that the approach to re-equipping the troops had to be adjusted in order to factor in the combat experience acquired in Syria and the need to reinforce Arctic territories, as well as the western and southwestern borders.",syria,[]
2497,2017-05-17 14:40:00,"We discussed current issues on the international and regional agendas, of course, and looked at the crisis situations in Syria, Libya, Ukraine, and on the Korean Peninsula.",syria,[]

2519,2017-05-31 08:00:00,"First, I would like to note the constructive approach of Turkey and Iran, and, of course, the Syrian government, which, together with Russia, have managed to achieve a ceasefire.",syria,[]
2519,2017-05-31 08:00:00,The ceasefire would not have been possible without the so-called Syrian armed opposition.,syria,[]
2519,2017-05-31 08:00:00,I really hope (and what I am about to say is very important) that these zones do not become a prototype for the future territorial division in Syria.,syria,[]
2519,2017-05-31 08:00:00,"On the contrary, I expect that these de-escalation zones, if peace is established, and the people who will be controlling them, will cooperate with the official Syrian authorities.",syria,[]
2519,2017-05-31 08:00:00,"I do not think I have the right to determine the political future of Syria, be it with or without al-Assad.",syria,[]

2528,2017-06-02 17:10:00,We are not defending so much President Assad as Syrian statehood.,syria,[]
2528,2017-06-02 17:10:00,"We do not want Syria to be confronted with a situation similar to that in Libya or Somalia or Afghanistan, where NATO has been present for many years but the situation is not changing for the better.",syria,[]

2528,2017-06-02 17:10:00,"This is precisely why we began our operation in Syria, because we realised where things were headed.",syria,[]
2528,2017-06-02 17:10:00,"Firstly, when President Obama and I agreed to work together on destroying chemical weapons in Syria, we acted on the premise that those weapons were out there.",syria,[]
2528,2017-06-02 17:10:00,"Furthermore, our intelligence services received additional information suggesting that there were plans to re-enact a similar scenario in other parts of Syria, including near Damascus.",syria,[]

2541,2017-06-09 11:30:00,I would like to note that there are certain encouraging developments in the settlement of the Syrian crisis.,syria,[]
2541,2017-06-09 11:30:00,The most crucial achievements are the ceasefire between the government troops and armed opposition groups and the creation of de-escalation zones in Syria.,syria,[]

2545,2017-06-15 16:00:00,"Our task in the near future is to upgrade the level and combat capability of the Syrian Armed Forces and proceed to the facilities that we have created in Syria, including in Hmeimim (Hmeimim airport) and the Tartus naval base, leaving the Syrian forces to operate effectively and achieve required results on their own.",syria,[]
2568,2017-06-28 13:45:00,This was demonstrated convincingly by our antiterrorist operations in Syria.,syria,[]
2581,2017-07-04 16:05:00,We exchanged views on the Syrian crisis and other outstanding issues.,syria,[]
2581,2017-07-04 16:05:00,"As before, issues like the Korean Peninsula and Syria remain complicated.",syria,[]

2596,2017-07-08 17:20:00,"Based on the recent positive experience, relying on the good will of Iran, Turkey, and of course, the Syrian Government and President al-Assad, we can take further steps.",syria,[]
2596,2017-07-08 17:20:00,"The most important thing is – we have actually reaffirmed this, also in the documents establishing this zone in the south on the border with Jordan, and the area that borders on the Golan Heights – the most important thing is to ensure Syria’s territorial integrity, eventually, so that these de-escalation zones become the prototype of regions that could cooperate with each other and with the official Damascus.",syria,[]
2596,2017-07-08 17:20:00,"If we manage to do this, we will lay the groundwork, create the prerequisites for resolving the entire Syrian problem by political means.",syria,[]

2611,2017-07-25 15:10:00,"We now share a great responsibility to counter the ideology of terrorism and religious extremism, because it underpins the emergence of ISIS, and before that Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups operating in Syria and around the world.",syria,[]
2611,2017-07-25 15:10:00,This is what happened in Syria.,syria,[]
2611,2017-07-25 15:10:00,I believe that an exclusively military solution cannot help settle the crises in Iraq and Syria.,syria,[]
2616,2017-07-27 17:30:00,We still have to discuss the settlement process in Syria.,syria,[]
2616,2017-07-27 17:30:00,"Then the Syrians should decide, in a broad-based dialogue under the aegis of the UN and on the basis of Security Council Resolution 2254, what kind of country they want to live in.",syria,[]
2659,2017-09-01 01:00:00,I would like to say that it was largely thanks to the efforts of Russia and other concerned countries that conditions have been created to improve the situation in Syria.,syria,[]
2659,2017-09-01 01:00:00,We have delivered a powerful blow to the terrorists and laid the groundwork for launching the movement towards a political settlement and the return of the Syrian people to peace.,syria,[]
2659,2017-09-01 01:00:00,"However, the fight against terrorists in Syria and other countries and regions must continue.",syria,[]
2666,2017-09-04 09:30:00,"Regarding regional conflicts, above all Syria and Libya, we seek to play the most positive role in settling these conflicts.",syria,[]

2672,2017-09-05 10:00:00,"As for Syria and military operations, yes, the situation there has turned around for government troops.",syria,[]
2672,2017-09-05 10:00:00,"It is probably too early to say so, but it is obvious that the situation is changing drastically in Syria.",syria,[]
2672,2017-09-05 10:00:00,"That is an enormous job, and without the help of the international community, it will be difficult for the Syrian authorities to tackle these challenges.",syria,[]
2672,2017-09-05 10:00:00,Practically all my colleagues agree with this and are ready to contribute to improving the humanitarian situation in Syria.,syria,[]

2711,2017-10-03 14:00:00,"As you know, agreements on four de-escalation zones in Syria have been achieved in Astana with assistance from the guarantor countries – Russia, Iran and Turkey – and these have been supported by a great many countries.",syria,[]
2711,2017-10-03 14:00:00,These agreements have created conditions for implementing UN Security Council Resolution 2254 through a direct dialogue between the Syrian government and the opposition and for rallying their efforts to eliminate the hotbed of terrorism as soon as possible and to restore peace and unity in Syria.,syria,[]
2711,2017-10-03 14:00:00,Everyone who sincerely wishes peace to Syria and Syrians and who want to see refugees return to their homes should join these UN-led processes without any preconditions.,syria,[]
2714,2017-10-04 15:40:00,"This is to say that there is great potential, and we are confident about the future of Russia’s relations with Saudi Arabia, as well as other countries in the region: Egypt, Jordan, Israel, and Syria, of course.",syria,[]
2714,2017-10-04 15:40:00,"We agreed on a de-escalation zone in Idlib, taking into account Turkey’s, Iran’s, and Syria’s interests in both cases.",syria,[]
2714,2017-10-04 15:40:00,"We understand how sensitive this subject is for Turkey, as well as for Iran and Syria – I am not just talking about the situation in Iraq (we all know that)",syria,[]
2714,2017-10-04 15:40:00,"We have met once, and talked on the phone several times to discuss various matters of mutual interest, including the Syrian issue.",syria,[]
2714,2017-10-04 15:40:00,"There are fundamental matters of mutual interests, such as non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, fighting cyber-crime, energy policy, by the way, regional conflicts on which we continue to work together, as in Syria, fighting organised crime, terrorism – all these are our common interests.",syria,[]
2717,2017-10-05 14:45:00,"As concerns the Syrian crisis, we are committed to pushing for its resolution in line with the Geneva I decisions and UN Security Council Resolution 2254, to finding a political solution that would guarantee security, stability and Syria’s unity and territorial integrity.",syria,[]

2733,2017-10-14 19:50:00,"These agreements lay the groundwork for implementing UN Security Council Resolution 2254 based on a direct dialogue between the government and the opposition, uniting their efforts in the interest of the quickest possible eradication of this hotbed of terrorism, and establishment of peace and preservation of Syria’s unity.",syria,[]
2738,2017-10-18 17:15:00,"We discussed in detail urgent crises, for instance in Syria and Libya, and global challenges that the international community is facing.",syria,[]
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,"As you have probably guessed, I am referring to the experience of Syria.",syria,[]
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,"Russia is opposing terrorists together with the legitimate Syrian Government and other states of the region, and is acting on the basis of international law.",syria,[]
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,"We are firmly convinced that even the most complex knots – be it the crisis in Syria or Libya, the Korean Peninsula or, say, Ukraine – must be disentangled rather than cut.",syria,[]
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,The first thing I would like to do regarding the Syrian settlement and the Astana process is to thank President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev for making it possible for us and the other participants of this process to meet in Astana.,syria,[]
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,"Thanks to the stand taken by Turkey, Iran and, of course, the Syrian Government, we were able to narrow the gaps in the sides’ positions on the key issue of ending the violence and creating de-escalation zones.",syria,[]
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,"It is the most significant result we have achieved in Syria over the past two years, particularly as part of the Astana process.",syria,[]
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,"Therefore, if we finish off the pockets of terrorist resistance in Syria, this certainly does not mean the threat to Syria, the region and the world as a whole is gone – absolutely not.",syria,['region']
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,"There is an idea to call a congress of the Syrian people, bringing together all ethnic and religious groups, the government and the opposition.",syria,[]
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,"Such a threat does exist, but as I said earlier, I do not want this to be a blueprint to partitioning Syria, but on the contrary, a situation where, once the de-escalation zones are in place, the people who control these zones would start making contact with Damascus, with the government.",syria,[]
2739,2017-10-19 20:10:00,We just talked about Syria.,syria,[]
2746,2017-10-24 18:10:00,I brought the President up to date on our efforts in fighting terrorism in Syria.,syria,[]
2746,2017-10-24 18:10:00,"The issues that we discussed today during our candid dialogue included both the Cyprus issue and bilateral relations in their entirety, the relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation, a number of regional and international matters, including Ukraine and the role of the European Union in this matter, as well as a serious issue such as the crisis on the Korean Peninsula and in Syria.",syria,[]
2746,2017-10-24 18:10:00,"Regarding international issues, we talked about the need to implement the Minsk agreements and the Normandy format and also addressed such serious problems as Syria, North Korea and denuclearisation, noting that these problems can only be dealt with through dialogue.",syria,[]
2750,2017-10-25 19:15:00,We naturally covered important issues of the international agenda and thoroughly discussed the situation in Syria.,syria,[]

2762,2017-11-01 19:20:00,"In both cases, we discussed in detail security in the region, issues linked with Iran’s nuclear programme, and, of course, the situation in Syria.",syria,[]
2762,2017-11-01 19:20:00,We manage to coordinate our positions on Syria-related problems.,syria,[]
2762,2017-11-01 19:20:00,Owing to our joint efforts and the efforts of Turkey the fight against terrorism in Syria is proceeding very well.,syria,[]
2773,2017-11-09 18:40:00,I would like to reiterate what I said earlier at a meeting with fewer participants and to thank Mr Nazarbayev for his great contribution to hosting international meetings on Syria in Astana.,syria,[]
2773,2017-11-09 18:40:00,"The opportunity for an early resolution of the Syria crisis, and the achievement by the Syrians themselves of the agreements to launch the political settlement process became possible largely thanks to the Astana talks.",syria,[]
2774,2017-11-10 11:15:00,"I lost almost all of my troops because of the snipers, which were covered in buildings just like in Syria.",syria,[]
2778,2017-11-11 13:30:00,"And as you know, we also agreed a joint statement on fighting terrorism in Syria.",syria,[]
2778,2017-11-11 13:30:00,"In this respect, I mean the former and the latter, we can state that the work on the APEC summit’s sidelines was useful and successful because it was no easy to arrive at the statement on Syria.",syria,[]
2778,2017-11-11 13:30:00,"As to Syria, I think it crucial that we have confirmed the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.",syria,[]
2778,2017-11-11 13:30:00,"As of today, it is absolutely obvious that the military efforts to liquidate the terrorist hotbed in Syria are nearing completion.",syria,[]
2778,2017-11-11 13:30:00,"The latest developments in the southeast of the country testify to this – it was practically the last ISIS stronghold, a town on the Syria-Iraq border in the southeast, followed by the liberating of the eastern bank of the Euphrates.",syria,[]
2778,2017-11-11 13:30:00,I think it will be a significant factor in settling the Syria problem.,syria,[]
2778,2017-11-11 13:30:00,"The fact that even under such conditions we manage to agree on anything (I mean the Syria statement) is already good, albeit too little.",syria,[]
2780,2017-11-13 17:45:00,We cooperate very closely on security in the Syrian region.,syria,[]
2781,2017-11-13 21:25:00,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, During my recent telephone conversation with Mr Erdogan, we agreed to hold a meeting in Sochi to thoroughly discuss the current state of bilateral affairs, give additional impetus to their development, and continue our exchange on the situation in the region, including, of course, the Syrian settlement process.",syria,[]
2781,2017-11-13 21:25:00,"Of course, the Syrian settlement was also on the agenda today.",syria,[]
2781,2017-11-13 21:25:00,These efforts must above all focus on a political settlement and on assisting the Syrian people in post-conflict recovery.,syria,[]
2781,2017-11-13 21:25:00,"I informed Mr President that at the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in Danang, the President of the United States and I approved a joint statement on the main approaches to the situation in Syria.",syria,[]
2781,2017-11-13 21:25:00,"Specifically, we highlighted the need to secure a definitive victory over ISIS, and rigorously respect the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian state.",syria,[]

2806,2017-11-22 18:40:00,"The role of the international community in the future of Syria should, of course, be focused on providing assistance to the people of that country in order for them to be able to achieve stability, to put an end to the suffering of this nation, to foreign interference and the imposition of the views of others on the people of Syria.",syria,[]
2806,2017-11-22 18:40:00,"In order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Syria, it is necessary to include this in the agenda, and to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their native lands.",syria,[]
2806,2017-11-22 18:40:00,"The recovery of Syria, as well as economic development in that country, requires the full support of the international community with an emphasis on rebuilding damaged and destroyed infrastructure, as well as creating production opportunities in that country, including the participation of the countries of the region.",syria,[]

2832,2017-12-06 18:45:00,"To get started, it is necessary to take at least the first steps – consolidate the current situation and de-escalation zones, put a complete end to the bloodshed on Syrian territory and transition to a peaceful, political settlement process.",syria,[]

3039,2018-05-17 21:35:00,"We proceed from the assumption that in view of the significant victories and success achieved by the Syrian Army in its fight against terrorism, and the start of a more active phrase of the political process, foreign armed forces will be withdrawing from the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.",syria,[]

3041,2018-05-18 16:45:00,What signal do you have from Russia that it will exert pressure on Syria to resume the political process finally?,syria,[]
3041,2018-05-18 16:45:00,"As for the first part of your question, I would like to emphasise that refugees are already returning in large numbers to the regions liberated by the Syrian army.",syria,[]
3041,2018-05-18 16:45:00,"Moreover, people were transferred with the help of our military police to other regions of Syria, including Idlib, from areas that they left of their own free will, for instance, Eastern Ghouta.",syria,[]
3041,2018-05-18 16:45:00,It is necessary to depoliticise humanitarian relief and economic recovery in Syria.,syria,[]
3041,2018-05-18 16:45:00,"If the Europeans want people to return home from Europe, it is necessary to remove the restrictions on aid to Syria that we do not understand, at least in the regions that are controlled by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic.",syria,[]
3041,2018-05-18 16:45:00,"To be honest, Syria does not have much ability to fix this; they are very limited in what they can do.",syria,[]
3041,2018-05-18 16:45:00,"If Europe wants people to return home from Europe, it is necessary to help Syria rebuild its economy and provide real humanitarian relief.",syria,[]
3055,2018-05-24 21:30:00,"I believe this will help us find solutions and work together in all areas, be it Ukraine, the Middle East, Iran, Syria, or a multilateral approach to international politics as we see it.",syria,[]

3056,2018-05-24 22:20:00,I have always said that our priority in Syria is the struggle against terrorism and the Islamist threat.,syria,[]
3056,2018-05-24 22:20:00,We want to find an inclusive political solution that will allow the Syrian people to draft a new constitution and elect a government.,syria,[]

3056,2018-05-24 22:20:00,This work will enable us to be truly useful to Syria and to help the Syrian people to gain access to humanitarian aid.,syria,[]
3056,2018-05-24 22:20:00,"We, that is, the international coalition, are destroying the last ISIS bases in Syria, and we should do all we can to ward off the risk of this organisation having a resurgence.",syria,[]

3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"They headed for Syria, and reached a neighbouring country, Lebanon I think.",syria,[]
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"But, instead of waiting one or two days and allowing the commission to work on the site, a missile attack was made on Syria.",syria,[]
3081,2018-06-05 17:30:00,"Naturally, during the talks we exchanged views on a number of international and regional issues and talked about the developments in Ukraine and Syria.",syria,[]

3082,2018-06-05 18:30:00,"I have already said it many times, and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate once again: if Europe wants the flow of migrants to Europe, including from this region – from Syria, from neighbouring countries – to decrease, it is necessary to help people to return to their homes, to help them to rebuild their lives in their own country.",syria,[]
3086,2018-06-07 16:30:00,Our contingent in the Syrian Arab Republic is not just military… What I want to say is this.,syria,[]

3086,2018-06-07 16:30:00,"Syria is not a shooting range for Russian weapons, but we are still using them there, our new weapons.",syria,[]
3086,2018-06-07 16:30:00,"As I said, and I will repeat, when we started to use these modern weapons, including missiles, whole teams from our defence industry companies went to Syria, and worked there on-site (it is extremely important for us!) to finalise them and figure out what we can count on when using them in combat conditions.",syria,[]
3086,2018-06-07 16:30:00,"Second, our commanders – we had a large number of officers and generals go in Syria and take part in these hostilities – began to understand what a modern armed conflict is, how important communication, intelligence, interaction between all-arms units and formations is, how important it is to ensure the effective operation of the aerospace group, aviation, ground forces, including special operations forces.",syria,[]
3086,2018-06-07 16:30:00,I have already said that we used them in Syria.,syria,[]

3160,2018-07-16 18:35:00,"Of course, we talked about regional crises, including Syria.",syria,[]
3160,2018-07-16 18:35:00,"With regard to Syria, restoring peace and harmony in that country could serve as an example of successful joint work.",syria,[]
3160,2018-07-16 18:35:00,We have all the requisite elements for effective cooperation on Syria.,syria,[]
3160,2018-07-16 18:35:00,"I would also like to note that after the terrorists are routed in southwest Syria, in the so-called “southern zone”, the situation in the Golan Heights should be brought into full conformity with the 1974 agreement on the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian forces.",syria,['southwest']
3160,2018-07-16 18:35:00,This will make it possible to bring tranquillity to the Golan Heights and restore the ceasefire between the Syrian Arab Republic and the State of Israel.,syria,[]
3160,2018-07-16 18:35:00,"Now large numbers of refugees are concentrated in countries bordering on Syria, such as Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan.",syria,[]

3167,2018-07-19 14:10:00,"I want to once again thank our military personnel who courageously performed and continue to perform their professional duty, and, of course, diplomats who are as extensively and selflessly involved in the Syria issue.",syria,[]

3167,2018-07-19 14:10:00,"Of course, it is extremely important that the international community intensify its efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the Syrians.",syria,[]
3167,2018-07-19 14:10:00,"This is clearly important for Syria and the rest of the region, as well as for many other countries, because our active efforts can reduce the migration pressure on European countries.",syria,[]
3167,2018-07-19 14:10:00,"Among other things, we discussed security at the Golan Heights during the operation in Syria.",syria,[]

3180,2018-07-27 15:40:00,"It is also designed to prevent an arms race in outer space, support the Astana process on a settlement in Syria and preserve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.",syria,[]
3180,2018-07-27 15:40:00,"In this context, we spoke about Syria, of course, and my colleagues welcomed our idea of encouraging a more active contribution to humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, which is an absolutely natural desire.",syria,[]
3180,2018-07-27 15:40:00,"As for the second question, about Syria, I have answered this.",syria,[]

3208,2018-08-24 15:45:00,"Thanks to our countries’ efforts and the involvement of other concerned states, I mean Iran in particular, as well as our cooperation with the United Nations, European countries and the United States, we have made significant progress towards settling the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
3225,2018-09-07 15:15:00,"President Rouhani, President Erdogan, colleagues, First, I would like to thank Mr Rouhani for the invitation to hold our trilateral meeting here in Tehran to discuss further joint steps by Turkey, Iran and Russia related to Syria.",syria,[]

3225,2018-09-07 15:15:00,"Russia is directly helping Syria on a regular basis by delivering food, medicines and other cargo to areas that were the hardest hit by military actions.",syria,[]
3225,2018-09-07 15:15:00,"Overall it would be useful to be consistent in our joint actions in the humanitarian area so as to help Syria rise from ruins, restore its industry, agriculture and infrastructure, thereby making it possible for the Syrians to return home in large numbers.",syria,[]
3225,2018-09-07 15:15:00,"Colleagues, let me repeat, that due to the painstaking efforts of Russia, Iran and Turkey, Syria is seeing impressive progress.",syria,[]

3226,2018-09-07 16:00:00,"At the same time, we consider unacceptable any attempts to spare terrorists or inflict damage on Syrian government troops under the pretext of protecting the civilian population.",syria,[]
3226,2018-09-07 16:00:00,This seems to be the objective of the attempts to fabricate chemical attacks allegedly perpetrated by the Syrian government.,syria,[]
3226,2018-09-07 16:00:00,"I would like to stress that armed opposition units in Syria are also joining in the anti-terrorist efforts, which I consider extremely important.",syria,[]

3226,2018-09-07 16:00:00,"Russia, Iran and Turkey attach great significance to coordinated efforts on improving the humanitarian situation in Syria, restoring its economy and solving pressing social problems.",syria,[]
3226,2018-09-07 16:00:00,We proceed from the assumption that it will be possible to ensure a mass return of Syrian refugees and internally displaced persons in the future.,syria,[]
3226,2018-09-07 16:00:00,Conditions were created in Syria to accommodate up to one million refugees.,syria,[]

3226,2018-09-07 16:00:00,"Let me reiterate – this happens always and everywhere, including a number of cases in Syria too.",syria,[]
3226,2018-09-07 16:00:00,"At the same time, all our agreements on Syria stem from the fact that we are striving and will strive to reconcile all the conflicting sides whereas we always bracketed out terrorist organisations.",syria,[]
3227,2018-09-07 17:30:00,I join your assessments of our joint contribution to the settlement of the Syrian crisis.,syria,[]
3247,2018-09-17 19:40:00,"As you know, only ten days ago we both took part in a Russian-Turkish-Iranian summit in Tehran on the Syrian settlement process.",syria,[]
3247,2018-09-17 19:40:00,"Colleagues, We certainly devoted a fair amount of attention to reaching a settlement in Syria.",syria,[]
3247,2018-09-17 19:40:00,"Let me recall that the concerns of the Russian side – and we were one of the nations that set up that de-escalation zone – our concerns today have to do with the threat posed by the militants concentrated there both to the province of Aleppo, the city of Aleppo, and our military facilities on Syrian territory:",syria,[]
3247,2018-09-17 19:40:00,Russia and Turkey have reaffirmed their commitment to fight terrorism in Syria in all its forms and guises.,syria,[]
3247,2018-09-17 19:40:00,"It is our common opinion that practical efforts to fulfill the planned steps will give an added boost to the political settlement process in Syria, step up work on the Geneva platform and contribute to the return of peace to Syrian soil.",syria,[]
3247,2018-09-17 19:40:00,This approach is generally supported by the leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic.,syria,[]
3247,2018-09-17 19:40:00,We will soon hold additional consultations with the Syrian government.,syria,[]
3247,2018-09-17 19:40:00,"We will continue working to form a constitutional committee from among representatives of the Syrian government, opposition forces and civil society.",syria,[]

3250,2018-09-18 16:00:00,"First, there were immigrants from Syria, Iraq and other Middle East countries.",syria,[]
3250,2018-09-18 16:00:00,"As for reciprocal action, this will be primarily aimed at ensuring additional security for our military and our facilities in the Syrian Arab Republic.",syria,[]
3254,2018-09-19 17:20:00,This programme takes into account the current global trends in terms of arms and combat equipment development and the experience gained from using Russian weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic.,syria,[]
3270,2018-10-02 20:30:00,"Before we take up the main issue we wanted to discuss today, I would ask the Defence Minister to report on progress in carrying out my instructions on Syria.",syria,[]
3270,2018-10-02 20:30:00,How long will it take to train the crews of the Syrian army to operate the S-300?,syria,[]
3273,2018-10-03 15:45:00,"The first is that the United States must obtain the mandate of the UN Security Council to have its armed forces on the territory of another country, in this case Syria, or receive an invitation from the legitimate Syrian government to deploy its troops there for whatever reason.",syria,[]
3273,2018-10-03 15:45:00,We have been operating on the premise that we nonetheless cooperate with our US partners in fighting terrorism and ISIS in Syria.,syria,[]
3273,2018-10-03 15:45:00,"But as ISIS gradually ceases to exist in Syria, there is just no other rationale, even outside the framework of international law.",syria,[]
3273,2018-10-03 15:45:00,We must strive to ensure that there are no foreign troops from other countries in Syria at all.,syria,[]
3273,2018-10-03 15:45:00,"Yes, including Russian, if the Syrian government so decides.",syria,[]
3273,2018-10-03 15:45:00,"Maybe it is related, since Syria also produces energy resources and influences the market situation one way or another.",syria,[]
3273,2018-10-03 15:45:00,"In this sense, yes, we need a stable Syria, no question about it.",syria,"['stable', 'question']"
3277,2018-10-03 21:50:00,"As you said, today we will speak about some challenging problems such as the situation in Ukraine and Syria.",syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,We also discussed the issue of resolving the Syrian crisis.,syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,We would like to point out Austria’s readiness to participate in humanitarian campaigns to support the Syrian people.,syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,"It is important for the aid to be provided via the channels approved by the legitimate authorities, and for it to extend to all Syrian regions affected by the terrorist aggression and the civil war.",syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,<…> Question (retranslated): My question is about Syria.,syria,[]

3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,"For several months now, Russia has been encouraging European countries to finance the recovery efforts in Syria.",syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,"Speaking about the Idlib de-escalation zone, militants from all across Syria were brought there.",syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,"We are concerned about the fact that Syrian residential areas, including the second largest city, Aleppo, have recently been subject to more frequent shelling from that zone.",syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,"During the talks, we had an idea to create a demilitarised zone 15 to 20 km deep in order to heighten the security of the Syrian civil facilities, cities, residential areas and our military base in Khmeimim.",syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,All this would have been impossible without the coordination of such agreements with the Syrian official authorities and without the support of Iran.,syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,"I do not know how united Europe will act in relation to rendering assistance to the Syrian population, but, in my opinion, it is necessary to depoliticise this work.",syria,[]
3278,2018-10-03 22:00:00,You cannot divide the people of Syria depending on where they live.,syria,[]
3280,2018-10-05 12:20:00,I told the Prime Minister about the developments in Syria.,syria,[]
3287,2018-10-11 14:30:00,"Russia’s actions to settle acute regional crises, including the Syrian crisis, are based on such principal approaches.",syria,[]
3287,2018-10-11 14:30:00,"With our decisive role, it has been possible to deal a devastating blow to international terrorism and preserve the statehood of Syria.",syria,[]
3287,2018-10-11 14:30:00,"Based on the results of the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi and Resolution 2254 of the UN Security Council, the groundwork was laid for boosting peace talks.",syria,[]
3287,2018-10-11 14:30:00,"Together with our partners in the Astana format, we are actively working on forming an intra-Syrian constitutional committee.",syria,[]
3287,2018-10-11 14:30:00,We hope that assistance to Syrians in solving these problems will be a common objective for the global community.,syria,[]
3296,2018-10-17 16:00:00,We have informed our colleagues about the steps taken by Russia to resolve the Syria conflict.,syria,[]
3296,2018-10-17 16:00:00,We agreed to continue coordination to intensify the Syrian political process.,syria,[]
3296,2018-10-17 16:00:00,Allow me to remind you that Egypt secured the so-called Cairo Platform opposition group participation in the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi.,syria,[]
3296,2018-10-17 16:00:00,It is also important to make collective efforts to rebuild Syria’s economy and create favourable conditions for the return of the refugees.,syria,[]
3296,2018-10-17 16:00:00,We paid special attention to the developments in Syria during the talks.,syria,[]
3296,2018-10-17 16:00:00,We agreed that it is necessary to work to prevent further escalation of the situation in Syria.,syria,[]
3296,2018-10-17 16:00:00,"In this context, we agreed to call on UN special envoys to Syria to speed up the process of forming a constitutional commission as an important step to create the necessary conditions to resume political talks and reach a comprehensive political solution to meet the legitimate hopes of the brotherly people of Syria and maintain the territorial integrity of the Syrian state.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"Of course, terrorism still poses a great threat to our country as well, which was why we launched these operations in Syria.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"But we have largely ruled out that risk by our actions, because we did a lot of damage to the terrorists in Syria.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"The second, no less important thing, is that we have preserved Syrian statehood and in this sense helped stabilise the region.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"Therefore, I believe we have generally achieved the goals we had set for ourselves in starting the operation in the Syrian Arab Republic; we have achieved a result.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,While we have liberated almost 95 percent of the entire territory of the Syrian Republic.,syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"We supported Syria’s statehood, prevented the state from collapsing.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,What does Syria or Crimea have to do with Japan?,syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,It is better to worry about our military personnel on the territory of Syria instead of having to worry about our fighters on Russia’s territory.,syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,It is not up to Russia to persuade Iran to leave Syria.,syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"After all, both Syria and Iran are sovereign countries, and they should build their own relationship.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"Yes, Russia does have serious, deep-rooted ties both with Iran and Syria.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"As for the complete withdrawal, this is a separate issue that has to be resolved through dialogue between Iran and Syria, as well as between Iran and the United States.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"Third, in order for Syria to move forward with the help of its allies, including Iran, the Syrian state needs a safe and enabling environment.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"This means that those who want Iranian troops to withdraw from Syria must guarantee non-interference in the domestic affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, stop funding terrorists or using them for political aims to fight the legitimate regime in Syria, its government, and so on.",syria,['government']
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"As I have already pointed out in public, Russia believes that once the decisions of this kind are taken, including the definitive victory over terrorists, all foreign troops must leave the Syrian Arab Republic as the country improves its defence capability and in keeping with the wishes of the Syrian government.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"As for Egypt’s participation in the Syrian settlement, it is significant.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"We see that Cairo has a positive influence on these people and encourages them to work with the Government of Syria, but, naturally, they have their own position on how the work should be organised.",syria,[]
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"But at any rate, at a certain level, as we now deal with the Syrian crisis, we have developed a way of cooperation between Russia, Iran and Turkey, which is working and is rather effective, although we do not use the same approach for everything that is taking place in the region.",syria,[]
3308,2018-10-24 19:15:00,We exchanged opinions on the situation in Syria.,syria,[]
3308,2018-10-24 19:15:00,"We informed Mr Conte of the steps Russia is taking, including in the Astana framework, to promote a political settlement and to step up inter-Syrian talks.",syria,[]
3308,2018-10-24 19:15:00,Restoration of Syria’s economy will create favourable conditions for the refugees to return and in this way will reduce the migration load on the European countries and Syria’s neighbours.,syria,[]
3308,2018-10-24 19:15:00,We also exchanged views on the developments in Syria.,syria,[]
3310,2018-10-25 14:20:00,"At the same time, it is necessary to fully take into account the experience of the military operation in Syria, the nature of potential threats and to solve increasingly complex and multifaceted tasks.",syria,['nature']
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,We discussed the situation in Syria and did substantial work on agreeing approaches to the key questions of the Syrian settlement.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"The Joint Statement we adopted reflects the commitment of Russia, Turkey, the Federal Republic of Germany and France to further expansion of cooperation in the interest of normalising the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, launching an effective intra-Syrian dialogue and conducting necessary government reforms and transformations.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"The larger part of Syria’s territory has been liberated from terrorists, and the country is gradually moving towards peaceful development.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"All the meeting participants agree on the key point: long-term stability in Syria can be achieved exclusively by political and diplomatic means in total compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 2254 and with strict observance of the principles of the Syrian Arab Republic’s unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"Importantly, it is the Syrian people themselves who must determine their country’s future.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"In our view it would contribute to the launch of a real political process in Syria, and attract an increasing number of interested and constructive minded representatives of Syrian society.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"Above all, it is essential to launch the work of the Constitutional Committee in Geneva, which is designed to consider the fundamental questions of Syria’s future state structure.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,The decisions taken at the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi must be taken into account in this process.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,Such a committee must undoubtedly be recognised as legitimate by all Syrian parties and enjoy their respect.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"Only in this case can the structure be viable and effective, able to prepare and conduct a long-overdue constitutional reform that will bolster Syrian statehood and unite Syrian society.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"Even though the level of violence in Syria has decreased considerably, the elimination of the remaining radical elements remains a crucial task.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"In case the radical elements impede the implementation of this task, if they conduct armed provocations from the Idlib zone, Russia reserves the right to render effective support to the decisive actions of the Syrian government on eliminating this hotbed of terrorist threat.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,A great deal of attention was given today to the issues of administering humanitarian aid to Syria’s population and assisting in the return of the refugees.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,We asked our partners to support the Russian initiative on organising an international conference on Syrian refugees.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,Conditions have been created in the Syrian Arab Republic to accommodate up to 1.5 million people and the Syrian government issued hard guarantees of safety and non-discriminatory treatment of all those who want to come back to their homes.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,It would be counter-productive to tell you about all the ways and methods of persuasion of the Syrian government.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"In order to make this work successful, we need to act calmly and with due respect to the legitimate government of the Syrian Arab Republic.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"By the way, everybody says “Syrian regime” while the UN Security Council Resolution uses “government of the Syrian Arab Republic.”",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"Proceeding from this, showing respect for the legitimate government on the one hand, but taking into account the need to establish a constructive dialogue with the opposition (and we always urge the Syrian government to begin such a dialogue), and using today’s declaration, which we together with our colleagues approved during the discussion, we presume that before the end of 2018, given relevant conditions, a Constitutional Committee will be established and will begin its work.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,I would like to remind you that at the Syrian People’s Congress in Sochi the decision was made to establish such a committee.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"After this, we managed to agree with both the opposition and President al-Assad on the formation of two of its part: one from the opposition and the other from the Syrian government.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"Undoubtedly, we should hold comprehensive consultations with both the Syrian government and our partners in Iran, because without Iran, which, as we know, is a guarantor of the peace process, the ceasefire and the creation of demilitarized zones, the problem cannot be resolved efficiently.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,In what context did you discuss the future political order in Syria?,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,"Our principled position is that it is the Syrian people who must decide on the fate of their own country, including people on the political stage.",syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,I pointed out that Russia reserves the right to support the Syrian government if terrorists carry out acts of provocation from the Idlib zone.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,Holding the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi was not an easy thing to do.,syria,[]
3315,2018-10-27 20:30:00,We have convinced the Syrian Government to present their part of the list for the Constitutional Committee.,syria,[]
3320,2018-10-31 13:30:00,"Professional legal assistance has been provided to over 70,000 people, including in such trouble spots as Syria, Yemen and Libya.",syria,[]
3320,2018-10-31 13:30:00,One of them is located at the University of Damascus in Syria.,syria,[]
3323,2018-11-01 16:40:00,A major summit on Syria was held several days ago.,syria,[]
3326,2018-11-02 17:20:00,This is what they sought to create in Syria – a stronghold of chaos and violence.,syria,[]
3326,2018-11-02 17:20:00,"I will add that military intelligence undoubtedly deserves a lot of credit for returning peace to many regions of Syria, for stopping the bloodshed and opening up a path to accord, and no less important, for the crushing blow we dealt to the terrorists, preventing them from returning to our territory.",syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"Finally, we talked about the hotbeds of tension, such as Syria, the North Korean nuclear programme, and our relations with Iran under the JCPOA – all these and other issues in which the United States and Russia are involved.",syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"The point here is that we are ready for full-scale work, including in those sectors of the Syrian economy where this could be beneficial both for us and for Syria.",syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"This joint work will certainly create jobs, result in the restoration of Syria’s infrastructure, and so on.",syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,There is a great deal of work in Syria.,syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"Back during our meeting in Istanbul, when I said that we should help by sending medication and medical equipment to Syria, it seemed to me that our European partners understand these problems and appear ready to work together on these humanitarian matters.",syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,Our cargo aircraft were used to deliver humanitarian aid to Syria.,syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"I hope to continue this work not only with France but also with other European countries, all of which are highly interested, as I see it, in restoring Syria.",syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,Because only if Syria is restored will we see people returning back to their homes on a large scale.,syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"They must abandon their phobias and help the Syrian people regardless of any political considerations, by promoting the political process, of course.",syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,We have not planned it so far but we did speak about the tragedy that took place in Syria.,syria,[]
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"Naturally, we talked about this and some other issues linked with bilateral relations, the situation in the region as a whole and in Syria in particular.",syria,[]
3350,2018-11-19 20:40:00,"First, we need to improve combat training while specifically using our experience in Syria.",syria,[]
3364,2018-11-30 16:45:00,"Thus, in Syria, where militants continue armed attacks on the government forces, the November 24 attack on residents of the western districts of the city of Aleppo involving the use of toxic chemical agents, presumably chlorine, was a blatant violation of the ceasefire.",syria,[]
3364,2018-11-30 16:45:00,"Dozens of Syrians were affected, including children.",syria,[]
3364,2018-11-30 16:45:00,"For a long-term stabilisation of the situation in Syria, it is important to promote an actual political settlement process.",syria,[]
3365,2018-11-30 21:10:00,"We naturally have issues to discuss, things to work together on, and I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss this on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, particularly the situation in Syria.",syria,[]
3369,2018-12-01 23:30:00,"Among other things, we talked earlier about the need to restore our trade and economic ties and cooperation in other areas, including such conflict areas as Syria, Afghanistan, North Korea; this is also a big problem for everyone.",syria,[]
3369,2018-12-01 23:30:00,"We use every opportunity to meet and talk, including discussing Syria updates.",syria,[]
3382,2018-12-07 18:30:00,"Those who fought and won in Afghanistan, took on terrorists in Russia and fight now in Syria.",syria,[]
3397,2018-12-18 14:00:00,I would like to make special mention of the fact that the weapons tested in Syria and the experience of the Army service personnel in the struggle against the terrorists were used in the operational and combat training drill.,syria,[]
3397,2018-12-18 14:00:00,The situation in Syria is gradually being stabilised after the rout of major groups of militants.,syria,[]
3397,2018-12-18 14:00:00,We will give Syrians all the support they need.,syria,[]
3397,2018-12-18 14:00:00,"They are helping revive Syria as a single, peaceful and stable state.",syria,[]
3397,2018-12-18 14:00:00,"According to our military experts, actually, their use in Iraq and Syria showed that their efficiency is around 30 percent.",syria,[]
3400,2018-12-20 15:50:00,I already said that we achieved significant progress in the fight against terrorism in that territory and delivered major strikes on ISIS in Syria.,syria,[]
3400,2018-12-20 15:50:00,The military contingent can only be there under a resolution of the UN Security Council or at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian Government.,syria,[]
3400,2018-12-20 15:50:00,Russian troops were invited by the Syrian Government.,syria,[]
3400,2018-12-20 15:50:00,"Despite all the disagreements, our specialists, our military personnel, security services and foreign ministries have established a rather constructive dialogue to address acute issues in combating terrorism in Syria.",syria,[]
3400,2018-12-20 15:50:00,"Although our interests have not always coincided on some matters, we have managed to make compromise decisions on how to resolve the Syria crisis.",syria,[]
3400,2018-12-20 15:50:00,"We respect the national interests of the Turkish Republic and the Turkish people in this area, and we see that our Turkish partners are willing to compromise and so together we make these compromise decisions to secure the development of a favourable situation in Syria and for the sake of fighting terrorism and strengthening our relations.",syria,[]
3400,2018-12-20 15:50:00,"Work at the expert level on Syria, for example, is ongoing.",syria,[]
3441,2019-01-23 17:40:00,"Of course, we also deal with regional security and cooperate extensively on Syria.",syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,They were devoted to the settlement in Syria.,syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,We largely concentrated on economic issues and humanitarian ties but certainly spoke at length about the situation in Syria.,syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,We discussed in detail the prospects for the inter-Syrian political process.,syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,"Russia and Turkey assume a clear-cut position of principle – to achieve a long-term settlement of the Syrian crisis on a political and diplomatic basis, primarily, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254 and with strict observance of the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.",syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,"At this time, this format is the most effective mechanism for settling the conflict in Syria.",syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,"We, of course, focused on establishing a Constitutional Committee, which will deal with key aspects of the future structure of the state in Syria.",syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,We also discussed issues related to finally putting a stop to all terrorist groups’ activities in Syria.,syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,Another topic of discussion was the US leadership’s intention to withdraw US troops from the north-east of Syria and its effect on developments in the Syrian Arab Republic going forward.,syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,"If these plans are really executed, it will be a positive step and would help stabilise the situation in this troubled area of Syria, currently under the control of Kurdish formations.",syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,"This dialogue would doubtless promote the consolidation of Syrian society and national accord, which would be in the interests of both Syria and all neighbouring countries.",syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,Cooperation between Russia and Turkey in the post-conflict development of Syria is of great importance.,syria,[]

3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,"As far as Syria is concerned, we discussed both the Idlib memorandum and the quadripartite summit.",syria,[]
3442,2019-01-23 21:30:00,Cooperation between Turkey and Russia is a touchstone of Syrian peace and stability.,syria,[]

3766,2019-09-16 20:00:00,"The leaders of the guarantor states of the Astana process on the settlement in Syria discussed issues related to the political process being carried out by the Syrians with the support of the United Nations, completing the formation of the Syrian Constitutional Committee and launching its work, the humanitarian situation, assistance for refugees and the restoration of the country’s infrastructure.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"I think the Astana process, of which Russia, Turkey and Iran are the guarantors, is an effective mechanism for facilitating a settlement in Syria.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"We will discuss key issues of settling the crisis in Syria, launching intra-Syrian political process, and helping Syrians recover their economy and their social needs.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,Our joint efforts have made it possible to stabilise the situation and reduce the level of violence in Syria.,syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"Thirteen meetings have already taken place in Nur-Sultan and Sochi with participation of Russia, Turkey and Iran, the Syrian sides, UN experts and observers from other interested parties, which have recently been joined by Iraq and Lebanon.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,The Russia-initiated Syrian National Dialogue Congress that took place in Sochi in 2018 played a major role.,syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,A decision was made to set up a constitutional committee with a view to drafting the parameters of future statehood in Syria.,syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"Naturally, it is essential to continue the uncompromising struggle against terrorist groups in Syria.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"Naturally, the situation in the northeast of Syria is a source of concern.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,Problems of security in this area and other parts of Syria should be resolved based exclusively on preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity.,syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,We consider it unacceptable to divide Syria into spheres of influence.,syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"Importantly, Russia, Iran and Turkey are helping Syrians in their post-conflict recovery, restoring the country’s economy and the social sphere and creating conditions for safe and unhindered access of the needy to humanitarian relief.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"The results of these joint efforts are obvious: since July 2018 over 390,000 refugees and about 1.3 million IDPs have returned to their homes in Syria.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"We hope the international community, especially the UN and its relevant agencies will be more active in joining the efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Syria and will increase their contribution to the restoration of its war-torn infrastructure, water and electricity supplies, destroyed schools and hospitals.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"Of course, such assistance must be granted to all Syrians without discrimination, politicization or any preconditions.",syria,[]
3767,2019-09-16 20:30:00,"Colleagues, I would like to express confidence that our talks will be productive and the agreements reached will help finally settle the crisis in Syria, strengthen its sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and make a tangible contribution to stability in the Middle East in general.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"Messrs Presidents, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, The fifth meeting of the guarantor states of the Astana process on the settlement in Syria was very successful and productive.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,The joint statement we adopted on its results has sealed our commitment to continued efforts towards a sustainable and viable peace in the Syrian Arab Republic.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"As the guarantors of the Astana process, our three countries stand for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,We believe that one of our priorities is to promote the intra-Syrian political dialogue.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"With this aim in view we will continue to hold regular expert meetings attended by representatives of the guarantor states, Syria, the UN and regional observers.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"In our opinion, we should help Syrians determine the parameters of their form of government themselves.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,I would like to remind you that this is why the decision to establish a Constitutional Committee was taken last year at the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,Diplomats from our three countries worked painstakingly to help the Syrian Government and opposition choose their candidates for the committee and the basic parameters of its operation.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"Russia, Turkey and Iran are ready to give every support to this while maintaining the leading role of the Astana process in the settlement in Syria.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,We hope that progress in the intra-Syrian political process will serve the interests of stronger security in Syria and the Middle East as a whole and will also help normalise relations between Damascus and Arab countries and restore its membership in the Arab League.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"Of course, we also held in-depth talks on the fight against terrorism in Syria.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,Russia is resolved to support the Syrian army during local operations aimed at neutralising the terrorist threat anywhere we see it.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"We are also concerned about the developments in northeast Syria, where ISIS sleeper cells have been revitalised.",syria,['northeast']
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,We believe that security can only be reliably ensured in that part of Syria if the legitimate government resumes control.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"Russia, supported by Turkey and Iran, is doing a great deal to provide humanitarian aid to the Syrian people.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"As I have already said, over 390,000 Syrian refugees and some 1.3 million internally displaced persons have returned back home since July 2018.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,Conditions are being created for launching a peaceful reconstruction in Syria.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"However, the problems facing the Syrian state are so large that the country needs the support of industrialised countries and international organisations to deal with them, but only if they really want to help the refugees return back home rather than use them and the internally displaced persons to achieve their own political goals, including in the potential future voting on the key topics of Syria’s development.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,I am confident that the results of our summit meeting will help bring about peace and stability in Syria.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,How will the activity of this committee influence the situation in Syria?,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"With due consideration for the US presence in Syria, I would also like to ask how you assess the US presence on Syrian territory?",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,We believe that the work of the Constitutional Committee will be a decisive factor in the final normalisation of the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,We worked with the government of Syria and the opposition until recently.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"Third, we must do all we can to prevent external forces from hampering the work of the parties to this process, namely, the Syrian people themselves.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"Regarding the presence of the US Armed Forces, it is common knowledge that their presence on Syrian territory is illegal.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"And we hope that the decision to withdraw US service personnel from Syria, made by President of the United States Donald Trump     Trump DonaldPresident of the United States of America , will be implemented completely.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"Regarding the Constitutional Committee in Syria, I would refrain from indicating any specific timeframes, although it has to be done as soon as possible.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,Let me reiterate that Syrians must be able to address by themselves the serious problems their country has been facing over the past years.,syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,"We all stand for the territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic, proceeding from the premise that when questions related to ensuring security and fighting terrorism are resolved, Syria’s territorial integrity will be fully restored.",syria,[]
3768,2019-09-16 22:00:00,This also refers to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.,syria,[]
3784,2019-10-01 17:15:00,"We will also discuss bilateral issues, the JCPOA and the situation in the region, including in the Syrian Arab Republic – this time here, in Yerevan.",syria,[]
3791,2019-10-03 14:30:00,"Without the role of Russia on many of issues – whether it is the peace process, whether it is Syria and others – things would not be able to move forward.",syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,Those of you who attended the 2015 Valdai Club meeting will apparently remember that at virtually the very same time the decision was taken on Russia’s operation in Syria.,syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,"We defeated the terrorist international that was actually winning on Syrian territory, and we prevented the return, the infiltration of hundreds and later, perhaps, thousands of armed cut-throats into our country and neighbouring countries with whom we have a visa-free regime, our borders are transparent.",syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,"Most of Syria was freed from terrorists within several years, and the level of violence has drastically decreased.",syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,"In conjunction with our Astana format partners and with the support of the UN, we managed to launch an intra-Syrian political process and to establish close working contacts with Iran, Turkey, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries of the Middle East, as well as the United States.",syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,We think the Syrian settlement can become a model for resolving regional crises where diplomatic mechanisms will be used in the vast majority of cases.,syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,"Indeed, in Syria, we were faced with an attempt to create a terrorist quasi-state with an actual – I am saying this without any exaggeration – an actual terrorist army.",syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,"In Syria, Russia and its partners (of course, we could never have done this alone) managed to do a lot while adhering to and following norms of international law, respecting sovereignty and thinking primarily about the life, safety and interests of the people.",syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,At that event Syrians themselves agreed to set up the Constitutional Committee in order to adopt a new Constitution or introduce amendments to the existing one.,syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,"I think there is this link because confrontation between the largest and most influential countries in the region is bound to affect the entire situation there, including Syria.",syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,"I know that the leaders of Saudi Arabia, which I am going to visit soon, and the leaders of Iran (we are in constant contact with our Iranian partners, and I met with the President of Iran just a few days ago) wish peace and all the best for the Syrian people.",syria,[]
3794,2019-10-03 18:30:00,We urge them to be guided by this noble motive and do everything they can to avoid using Syrian territory as an arena for confrontation.,syria,[]
3805,2019-10-11 15:30:00,"After their defeat in Syria, many militants are relocating to other regions, where they will want to get a foothold: to the Balkans, Southeast Asia, and, unfortunately for us, to the southern regions of the Commonwealth.",syria,[]
3805,2019-10-11 15:30:00,We see what is happening in the north of Syria due to the Turkish military operation.,syria,[]
3805,2019-10-11 15:30:00,"That is, there are areas in northern Syria where ISIS militants are concentrated.",syria,['northern']
3805,2019-10-11 15:30:00,"Will they withdraw to the Syrian hinterland, where there are areas that no one controls, and thence work their way to certain locations, through Iraq, through other countries in the region?",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"In this regard, I would like to emphasise the positive role Saudi Arabia has played in resolving the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"But I believe that without Saudi Arabia’s contribution towards a Syrian settlement, it would have been impossible to achieve a positive trend.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"We see what happened in the Syrian Arab Republic, what catastrophic events took place there.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"Many of our viewers have been asking straightforwardly: why has Russia taken such a harsh stance in the case of Syria, but the position regarding Libya and Iraq was perhaps not as hard?",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"As for Syria, we came to Syria to support the legitimate government, and I would like to emphasise the word ‘legitimate.’",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"They are, but it does not mean that we were to allow terrorist organisations to capture Syria and to establish a terrorist pseudo-state there.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"This idea was conceived right here, in Sochi, at the Syrian National Dialogue Congress that brought together various political forces, including the opposition and the government.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,And here Syrians agreed among themselves to set up a constitutional committee that would work on changing the Syrian Constitution or drafting a new one.,syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"Previously, I mentioned the positive role that we play in Syria.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,I can only agree with you that all the forces deployed illegitimately inside any sovereign state – in this case Syria – must leave.,syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"If Syria’s new legitimate government chooses to say that they have no more need for Russia’s military presence, this will be just as true for Russia.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,And I will be as open with you as I have been with my counterparts: Syria must be free from other states’ military presence.,syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,And the territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic must be completely restored.,syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"It is a difficult question, and it is a question that only Syrians can answer.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"This must be equally true for Sunnis and Shia, for Alawites and Christians, because Syria has always been a state with many religions, and it could pride itself on this.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"Only insane people could have started a deranged, purging campaign, killing other people, as these terrorists did in Syria.",syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,They are returning from abroad and from other Syrian provinces.,syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,I am happy to say that Syrians welcome and trust Russian troops and Russia’s military police.,syria,[]
3807,2019-10-13 13:00:00,"It is time to get Syria back into the Arab family, to re-instate it in the Arab League.",syria,[]
3811,2019-10-15 13:30:00,"We are expanding ties in the trade, economic, cultural and humanitarian fields and we are maintaining close coordination on major global and regional affairs, primarily regarding Syria, Libya, Yemen and the situation in the Gulf.",syria,[]
3816,2019-10-21 00:15:00,"It is yet another incentive to cooperate with Russia, which has abundant experience in fighting terrorism, including in Syria.",syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, We thank the President of Turkey for accepting our offer made during a recent telephone conversation, and today he and representatives of his delegation arrived in Sochi to discuss the developments in the Syrian Arab Republic, including in the northeast, beyond the Euphrates.",syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,Mr Erdogan     Erdogan Recep TayyipPresident of Turkey  gave a detailed explanation of the goals of the Turkish military operation along the Syrian border.,syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,Syria must be liberated from illegal foreign military presence.,syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,We believe that the only way to achieve strong and long-lasting stability in Syria is to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.,syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,"The Turks and the Syrians will have to protect peace on the border together, which would be impossible without mutually respectful cooperation between the two countries.",syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,"In addition to this, a broad dialogue between the Syrian government and the Kurds living in northeastern Syria must be launched.",syria,['northeastern']
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,It is clear that all the rights and interests of the Kurds as an integral part of the multi-ethnic Syrian nation can only be fully considered and fulfilled via such an inclusive dialogue.,syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,"Of course, during our talks with the President of Turkey, we discussed further steps to promote the peaceful political process in Syria, which the Syrians will conduct within the Constitutional Committee in cooperation with the United Nations.",syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,"We consider it necessary to continue helping Syrian refugees to return home, which will substantially alleviate the socioeconomic burden shouldered by the countries that agreed to take in Syrians.",syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,"We urge the international community, primarily relevant UN agencies, to be more active in rendering humanitarian aid to all Syrians going home, without any discrimination, politicisation and preconditions.",syria,[]
3820,2019-10-22 20:00:00,"I think these decisions are very important, if not historic, and will allow us to settle the fairly acute situation on the Syrian-Turkish border.",syria,[]
3848,2019-10-30 22:00:00,"It is a fact that Russia has done a great deal in the fight against the universal evil of terrorism, including in the Middle East as a whole, in Syria in particular, as well as in the fight against ISIS.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"First of all, regarding the contribution made by the United States to combatting terrorism in Syria, the US did have a role in these efforts.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"At the same time, before Russia came to Syria and became actively involved there, the so-called international coalition had been failing to make any headway for several years.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"These territories were not just liberated, but placed under the control of the legitimate Syrian government.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"In this sense, we cannot say that we have solved one hundred percent of our tasks, but overall, yes, we have fulfilled the task we had set when launching the operation in Syria.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"Now we are receiving more information from Syria, after Syrian border guards were stationed along the Syrian-Turkish border, for example, who is in the camps.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"So yes, it is a common problem; all countries are threatened with infiltration by Syrian fighters who leave Syria for other countries.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,We know tragic cases when fighters with military experience received in Syria attacked some European countries.,syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"By the way, we share elements of work on countering terrorism in Syria with many countries, including the United States.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"We – everyone who are still working on the Syrian problem – still have questions regarding the east bank of the Euphrates, where fighters and foreign presence, including the US presence, can still be found.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"I have said many times that we do not consider it legitimate, because these military groups are not stationed there at the invitation of the Syrian government or under the UN Security Council resolution, so it is illegal.",syria,[]
3870,2019-11-14 22:30:00,"I very much hope that during the political process in Geneva on amending or adopting a new Syrian Constitution we will be able to de-escalate, to establish relations between the government and the opposition one way or another, and find cardinal common solutions that will de-escalate the tensions in general and completely restore the territorial integrity of Syria.",syria,[]
3874,2019-11-20 15:20:00,"We are cooperating, one way or another, in the fight against terrorism, and we maintain operational interaction in Syria.",syria,[]
3881,2019-11-22 14:00:00,The operation against terrorist groups in Syria was a serious professional test for our military.,syria,[]
3897,2019-11-28 12:30:00,We are willing to share our experience of fighting terrorism gained in Syria and to use it in our efforts to improve the CSTO forces’ operational capabilities.,syria,[]
3901,2019-12-02 14:15:00,"The Navy has confirmed its high combat potential in the fight against terrorists in Syria, and I would like to note once again the smoothness of teamwork and coordination between the Navy’s units and task forces, as well as the professionalism of those involved in the operation, the supervisor personnel, sailors and naval aviators.",syria,[]
3901,2019-12-02 14:15:00,"Today, a Russian naval task group is permanently deployed in the eastern Mediterranean off the Syrian coast and there is our on-shore naval base at the port of Tartus.",syria,[]
3907,2019-12-04 18:00:00,"In doing so, we need to keep in mind the experience of using electronic warfare technology in exercises and during combat, considering that they were used quite actively during the operation in Syria.",syria,[]
3926,2019-12-19 16:20:00,"In Syria, we are witnessing developments in the camps and prisons where ISIS militants are held.",syria,[]
3935,2019-12-24 15:45:00,The Russian army continues to play a key role in achieving peace in Syria.,syria,[]
3935,2019-12-24 15:45:00,"Other systems have been fielded as well, including the ones that were tested during various exercises and in combat conditions in Syria, such as Kalibr cruise missiles.",syria,[]
3945,2020-01-07 16:00:00,I sincerely greet all personnel of the Russian forces in Syria on the New Year and Christmas.,syria,[]

3945,2020-01-07 16:00:00,I thank the commanders and the personnel of the Russian forces in the Syrian Arab Republic for the conscientiousness with which they fulfil their military duty.,syria,[]
3945,2020-01-07 16:00:00,"I want to emphasise once again that here in Syria, you are not only helping the Syrian people by liberating them from terrorist groups.",syria,[]
3945,2020-01-07 16:00:00,"Here, in Syria, you are defending your home country by preventing terrorists from reaching Russia and its neighbouring countries.",syria,[]

3946,2020-01-07 16:20:00,We have things to discuss; I am referring to the situation that is unfolding in both the Syrian Arab Republic and the region as a whole.,syria,[]
3946,2020-01-07 16:20:00,"As for Syria, your efforts and our joint work have dramatically changed things.",syria,[]
3946,2020-01-07 16:20:00,"Not only is there a dramatical change, we are witnessing the restoration of Syrian statehood, of Syria as a unified nation.",syria,[]

4626,2021-11-18 16:50:00,"Our direct involvement contributed to defeating international terrorism in Syria, preventing the country from disintegrating, and to launching the intra-Syrian settlement process under the auspices of the UN, as part of the Astana format with Turkey and Iran.",syria,[]
4626,2021-11-18 16:50:00,"Russian diplomacy should continue to contribute to the normalisation of relations between Syria and the Arab countries and an early return to the League of Arab States, as well as to enlist international assistance to improve the humanitarian situation in that country.",syria,[]

4674,2021-12-21 14:30:00,How did they go into Syria?,syria,[]
4681,2021-12-27 09:00:00,"I will specially highlight the fact that the Ministry’s specialists were actively and professionally engaged in Russia’s humanitarian missions in Afghanistan, Syria and other countries, and delivered coronavirus vaccines to Cuba, Mozambique, India and the Republic of South Africa.",syria,[]
4693,2022-01-10 11:45:00,"This was done for example during the CSTO’s recent Indestructible Brotherhood exercise, organised with due account of Russian service personnel’s combat experience in Syria.",syria,[]
4700,2022-01-19 18:30:00,We can say that our efforts largely helped the Syrian government overcome the threats linked with international terrorism.,syria,[]

4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,A similar fate was also prepared for Syria.,syria,[]
4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,The combat operations conducted by the Western coalition in that country without the Syrian government’s approval or UN Security Council’s sanction can only be defined as aggression and intervention.,syria,[]

4774,2022-03-31 17:35:00,"I would add that the United States will also try to make money on the current global instability, as it did during WWI and WWII, and its aggressions against Yugoslavia, Iraq and Syria, to name a few.",syria,[]

4854,2022-06-21 13:20:00,"Today’s Russian officers and soldiers – the successors of the generation of victors, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the Great Patriotic War heroes – are selflessly fighting for the Fatherland, for our people, fighting international terrorists in Syria, protecting Donbass from neo-Nazis, and defending peace and security for our people, and Russia’s right to sovereign development.",syria,[]

4868,2022-06-30 20:00:00,"It concerns, in part, information support for the Russian units deployed in Syria, the identification of the routes along which weapons and money are delivered to terrorists and the location of their bases, command posts and training centres.",syria,[]

4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"We hope to discuss in a practical and business-like spirit the urgent issues of stabilisation in Syria, and there are quite a few of them at present.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"Overall, the joint efforts of Russia, Iran and Turkiye to facilitate the comprehensive settlement of the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic are highly productive.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"Owing to the assistance and support of our countries, the level of violence in Syria has decreased significantly; peaceful life is returning and the country is gradually rebuilding its economy and social sphere.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,We believe the Astana Troika must continue playing a key role in the efforts to achieve complete normalisation in Syria and establish durable peace and civil accord in the country.,syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"Importantly, Russia proceeds from its firm commitment to the fundamental principles of unconditional respect for the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"We believe our task for the near future is to agree on specific steps to promote the intra-Syrian inclusive political dialogue, that is, to implement our agreement on creating conditions that will allow the Syrians to determine their future themselves, without outside interference.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"In fact, this is why our three states initiated the adoption of the decision to establish a Constitutional Committee at the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi in 2018.",syria,[]

4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"Importantly, the Syrians showed a willingness to come to terms, to search for and find consensus solutions on priority issues related to the future arrangement of their sovereign state.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,I am convinced that our countries will continue promoting cooperation in the interests of the ultimate elimination of the remaining hotbeds of international terrorism on Syrian territory.,syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"It is necessary to put an end, once and for all, to the presence of ISIS and other extremist groups in Syria.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,Let me stress that the situation on the territories outside the control of the Syrian government is particularly concerning.,syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"This is largely allowed through the destructive policy of the Western states led by the US which are using a broad arsenal of political and economic measures, are strongly encouraging separatist sentiment in some areas of the country, as the President of Iran just mentioned, and plundering its natural resources with a view to ultimately pulling the Syrian state apart.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"So, it would be best to take extra steps in our trilateral format aimed at stabilising the situation in those areas and at returning control to the legitimate government of Syria.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"I think it is important that Russia, Iran and Turkiye are making concerted efforts to render support to the Syrian people in the post-conflict recovery.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"In addition, it is necessary to see that other members of the international community, the respective UN agencies, and international development institutions play a more substantial role in providing Syria with assistance without politicisation or any preconditions.",syria,[]
4880,2022-07-19 22:00:00,"To conclude, I would like to express confidence that our talks will be useful and productive and the results will serve to enhance stability and security not only in Syria but also in the Middle East in general.",syria,[]

4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,The future of Syria will be determined by the Syrian people themselves without any enforcement of external formulas or models.,syria,[]

4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,"It eventually brought together representatives of the Syrian government, the opposition and civil society, giving them the opportunity to engage in direct dialogue and reach agreement on the parameters of the future state structure of their own country.",syria,[]
4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,"Of course, we are ready to cooperate with our Iranian and Turkish partners and, in coordination with the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Syria, to continue to facilitate the steady and uninterrupted functioning of the committee in every possible way, while maintaining the Astana format's leading role in the Syrian settlement.",syria,[]

4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,"Importantly, all participants supported continued cooperation in the fight against any manifestations of terrorism and extremism until the complete elimination of this threat in Syria and neighbouring countries.",syria,[]
4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,We will continue to closely monitor and effectively suppress any external forces’ attempts to use militants on Syrian territory to attain their own selfish geopolitical objectives in the Middle East or elsewhere.,syria,[]
4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,"This was the context for our discussion of the aggravated situation in northeastern Syria, east of the Euphrates, where, with the support of certain countries, attempts are being made to consolidate the illegal foreign military presence and incite separatist sentiments in violation of the Syrian state’s sovereignty.",syria,['northeastern']
4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,Russia reaffirmed its principled approach: the area to the east of the Euphrates should return under the control of the legitimate government of Syria.,syria,[]
4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,"When considering humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, we agreed from the outset that such assistance should be carried out in strict accordance with international law and the UN Charter.",syria,[]
4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,It is important to help all Syrians without exception to return to normal life.,syria,[]
4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,"In this regard, we once again call on the international community, especially the UN humanitarian agency, to increase support for Syria through the implementation of projects to restore the core infrastructure, water and electricity supply, schools, hospitals, as well as mine clearance projects.",syria,[]
4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,I am confident that the decisions adopted at this summit will help establish peace and stability in Syria and in the region as a whole.,syria,[]

4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,"The only mechanism that currently includes all parties to the conflict in Syria is the Constitutional Committee, which is also a product and the fruit of the Astana Three’s efforts.",syria,[]
4881,2022-07-19 22:20:00,We believe that the Constitutional Committee must ensure that all the legitimate rights of the Syrian people are upheld and all their legitimate demands are met.,syria,[]

4882,2022-07-19 23:55:00,"Humanitarian aid is being provided to Syria, for which there is particularly great demand today, because the sanctions imposed on Syria and the Syrian people have produced a deplorable result: nearly 90 percent of people in Syria are living below the poverty line.",syria,[]
4882,2022-07-19 23:55:00,The situation in Syria is extremely serious.,syria,[]
4882,2022-07-19 23:55:00,"This means that all humanitarian aid must be provided through the official Syrian authorities, through Damascus.",syria,[]

4882,2022-07-19 23:55:00,"However, in our view, in order to ensure a long-term, stable situation there it is necessary to transfer the entire territory under the control of the official authorities in Damascus, under the control of the Armed Forces of the Syrian Arab Republic, and then it will be possible to hold a dialogue with those who are responsible – in this case the official Syrian authorities.",syria,[]
4882,2022-07-19 23:55:00,"As I have said many times and would like to stress once again, the work of this tripartite group – Russia, Turkiye and Iran – this joint effort to search for compromises and find these compromises has led to the fact that over 90% of Syria is now under official government control and, as we say in such cases, we have broken the back of international terrorism there.",syria,[]
4895,2022-08-05 19:30:00,"Of course, we will also discuss the issues we have been dealing with for a long time, namely, regional security and above all, the Syrian crisis.",syria,[]
4946,2022-09-16 19:00:00,"As for our Commissioner for Children’s Rights, as we know, she has been involved in bringing our children from areas of hostilities: from Syria and Iraq, those children who have remained there due to various circumstances against their will, and I hope she will continue to do this, God bless her.",syria,[]
4974,2022-10-11 14:15:00,"The role of the United Arab Emirates and their influence on the regional situation are, of course, quite impressive, and I find it very important to discuss issues related to the situation in and around Syria with you.",syria,[]
4995,2022-10-27 20:55:00,"As I said, we usually find a solution even on very delicate issues, such as Syria, security issues and the economy, including infrastructure.",syria,[]

5059,2022-12-21 16:00:00,"In addition, the experience of the special military operation, as well as what our troops gained in Syria, should, as I have said, pave the way for a major improvement in combat training, and should be applied in our preparations and in our exercises and training at all levels.",syria,[]
5063,2022-12-23 18:30:00,"We began doing this a while back, in part when we used our weapons against the terrorist groups in Syria.",syria,[]
