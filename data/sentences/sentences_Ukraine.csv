833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"It was said from the start, including in Ukraine itself, and quite fairly too, that, “if we want to be independent, we have to pay for it, behave like an independent country and follow the norms of European and global practice.”",ukraine

833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"We have domestic reasons for our economic difficulties, and so does Ukraine.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,They are due to the situation on the markets for Ukraine’s main export products.,ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"Ukraine sells a roughly equal amount of goods to Russia and the European Union countries, for a value of around $17 billion in each case if I recall correctly.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"Of the $17 billion worth of Ukrainian goods exported to the Russian market, machinery and equipment account for $7 billion or more, but these particular goods account for only around $2 billion of Ukrainian exports to the EU, while agricultural goods and produce account for more than $5 billion.",ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"We are not against association, but are simply saying that we will have to protect our own economy because we have a free trade zone with Ukraine, and we will not be able to leave those doors wide open in the present situation if Ukraine opens its doors wide to the European Union.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"It will mean that output in Ukraine’s machine-building sector will continue to fall, because these goods are mostly sold on the Russian market, but it is unlikely that Ukraine’s agricultural and produce exports to Europe will increase because they have all kinds of non-tariff restrictions in place there, phytosanitary restrictions and so on.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,And the documents that were proposed for signing did not offer Ukrainian goods any preferential treatment.,ukrainian

833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"Let me say again that this decision is not about the interests of Ukraine’s current government, but is about the interests of Ukraine’s people.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,We fully realise that there are problems with Ukraine’s ability to meet these payments.,ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"A long time ago, under President Kuchma, we offered Ukraine the option of using the Ukrainian gas transit network jointly.",ukraine

833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,I’ve told you about the structure of trade flows in Ukraine.,ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"But if Ukraine adopts EU commercial standards, they won’t be able to sell to us anything at all.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"So, Ukraine will immediately become – and this is just by definition, you don’t need to think about it too hard, just read the documents – an agricultural appendage [to the EU].",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,And a lot of work will have to be done to get Ukrainian goods to the European market.,ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,I think that’s what concerns the Ukrainian leadership today.,ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"Because yes, it is support for the Ukrainian economy and Ukrainian people, without a doubt, but this money comes from the National Welfare Fund, as you know, our reserve funds.",ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"At the request of the Ukrainian side, these bonds will be posted on the Irish Stock Exchange and VTB Capital will be the manager of this transaction, again, at Ukraine’s request.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,It has nothing to do with Maidan or Ukraine’s negotiations with Europe.,ukraine

833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"I reiterate, we are doing it because of our special relationship with Ukraine and because we want to continue our cooperation, which we are also interested in.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"Incidentally, the machine-building industry products that we export from Ukraine are part of our cooperation heritage from the Soviet Union.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,And we can do it for the benefit of both the Ukrainian and Russian economies.,ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"Ultimately, as I have said many times, the Ukrainian politicians, economists and experts should make these calculations for themselves and adopt a pragmatic solution.",ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"And, of course, it will be tangible support for our Ukrainian friends.",ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,What do you mean by saying “now with Ukraine”?,ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"I realise that at the moment Ukraine is a ‘tasty’ subject arousing a lot of interest, following our decision.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"As for Ukraine, its rating is not high at the moment, but we have confidence in the Ukraine’s basic competitive advantages.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,We believe in Ukraine.,ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,We are aware of how much part of our industry depends on the situation in Ukraine in the companies they work with there.,ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"I suspect we also have nationalist-minded people, who could speak out loud about their position regarding Ukraine, and if we start counting them one by one, we would feel there are many of them.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,But the overwhelming majority of Russian citizens have a positive attitude toward Ukraine.,ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,I think the same is true in Ukraine.,ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"But I think this is largely due to insufficient information, in part concerning the European integration process in Ukraine.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,Some people are saying that the Ukrainian people have been robbed of their “European dream.”,ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"It is the choice of the Ukrainian people themselves and their legitimate authorities, whether or not to enter into any kind of union or to sign any documents, as I have already said many times.",ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"And our colleagues here, who raised the Ukraine sign, I want to ask them: did you read this paper?",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"I already said, this is very clearly tilting Ukraine toward becoming Europe’s agricultural appendage, but this is someone’s choice.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"After all, we are not dragging Ukraine anywhere; we have a free trade zone with Ukraine.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,We are not saying we will discriminate against Ukrainian goods.,ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"On the contrary, we are saying that if Ukraine signs this document, will we be forced to cancel all preferences.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"But as I already said, the Ukrainian goods will enjoy the most-favoured nation treatment.",ukrainian
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"At one point, Ukraine took American fuel and used it at Ukrainian nuclear power stations.",ukraine
833,2013-12-19 17:00:00,"We proceed from the fact that whoever wins this battle and however the situation unfolds in the future, we will still work with Ukraine and cooperate with it in such a way and such format that is the most interesting and acceptable for the Ukrainian people.",ukraine

867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"And if not, how will this conform to Russia’s constant promises to honour and respect Ukraine’s sovereignty?",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,The question concerning Ukraine signing an agreement with EU nations is not about Ukraine’s sovereign choice but about the consequences it will have on the Russian economy if it is signed.,ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"For example, can Ukraine exist within the framework of a free trade zone, of which Ukraine is already a part, and asked us for earlier?",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,We have the impression that Ukraine is being removed from the free trade zone.,ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,This is not because of Ukraine; it is because of us.,ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,Our understanding of the agreement is that goods produced in such a way on Ukraine’s territory are considered to be products made in Ukraine.,ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"As for our readiness to help Ukraine, I have already spoken about this and can repeat it now: both the loan we spoke about and the gradual quarterly decrease in energy prices, first and foremost gas, are based on necessity and our wish to provide support – not to a particular government, but to the Ukrainian nation.",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"Unfortunately, the state-owned Naftogaz of Ukraine has incurred a huge debt – $2.7 billion – since August 2013.",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"However, this process has not begun yet, and the Ukrainian side has asked for a deferment again.",ukrainian
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"Even worse, right now – I just heard about it this morning – the Ukrainian side is asking us to defer even this year’s payments, for gas received at discounted prices.",ukrainian
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"Still, these are all issues that need to be worked out, and we will continue a dialogue with our partners in Ukraine, regardless of who is heading the Ukrainian Government.",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,You ask if we will revise our loan and energy agreements with Ukraine if the opposition comes to power there.,ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,We had a very constructive dialogue with the Ukrainian Government when it was headed by Ms Tymoshenko.,ukrainian
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,We have never had any taboos about talking with representatives of all of Ukraine’s different political forces.,ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"The one thing that is of principle importance to us, as I have already said, is that we want Ukraine to have a solvent economy.",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,The Ukrainian economy must be able to generate a positive development effect so that the Government can carry out structural reforms and we can be sure that our loan will be repaid.,ukrainian
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"We do have big gold and foreign currency reserves, government reserves, but 15 billion is the amount the IMF planned to give Ukraine as a big international organisation, and in this case Russia has made this sum available on its own, or is in the process of doing so at any rate.",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"Second, as for advice to Ukraine on what to do and how to do it, I think the Ukrainian people are quite capable of deciding this for themselves.",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"We think that this is not a very good line to take in general, and given the specific situation in relations between Russia and Ukraine, it would be simply unacceptable and impossible as far as we are concerned.",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,I am not sure that Ukraine needs such mediation.,ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"For example, a priest in Western Ukraine was calling on the crowd to go to Kiev and topple the Government so as to – using his own words – “prevent negroes, russkies and yids from telling us what to do in our own home”.",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"We should call on the Ukrainian Government and President Yanukovych to use civilised methods, but at the same time, we should look at what his political opponents are doing too and call on them to also use civilised methods to fight their political battles.",ukrainian
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"First, you said that Ukraine put changes in our agenda today.",ukraine
867,2014-01-28 20:20:00,"We did indeed give a lot of attention to the question of the Eastern Partnership and in this context discussed Ukraine too, of course, as one of the countries currently in negotiations on this initiative.",ukraine
869,2014-01-29 15:35:00,"Naturally, we discussed Ukraine too.",ukraine
869,2014-01-29 15:35:00,"In this respect, I want to draw your attention to a matter that is worrying our Ukrainian colleagues and friends, namely, the fulfilment of our financial agreements.",ukrainian
869,2014-01-29 15:35:00,The idea was that the support measures for Ukraine’s economy and increased cooperation and intensification of trade and economic relations between our countries would give our Ukrainian colleagues advantages that they would then turn into new economic achievements.,ukraine
869,2014-01-29 15:35:00,"By the way, I would like to remind you that even the recent loan decision boosted Ukraine’s rating as a borrower for a while.",ukraine
869,2014-01-29 15:35:00,"However, our idea was that these positive developments would ultimately create the base Ukraine needs to be able to pay off its debts, including its gas debts.",ukraine
869,2014-01-29 15:35:00,"Let’s wait for the Ukrainian Government to form; however, I ask you not to lose contact with your colleagues, even in today’s situation.",ukrainian
869,2014-01-29 15:35:00,"I assume the Government of the Russian Federation will continue to carry out all of this work with their colleagues, even before the formation of the new Ukrainian Government.",ukrainian
869,2014-01-29 15:35:00,Does the actual volume of assistance we have provided Ukraine so far correspond to our agreements?,ukraine
869,2014-01-29 15:35:00,Are you in contact with the Finance Minister of Ukraine?,ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"First of all, my assessment of what happened in Kiev and in Ukraine in general.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"There is a question here that neither I, nor my colleagues, with whom I have been discussing the situation in Ukraine a great deal over these past days, as you know – none of us can answer.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"The result is the absolute opposite of what they expected, because their actions have significantly destabilised the east and southeast of Ukraine.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"In my opinion, this revolutionary situation has been brewing for a long time, since the first days of Ukraine’s independence.",ukraine

910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"There was a period in this country when the President appointed regional leaders, but then the local legislative authorities had to approve them, while in Ukraine they are appointed directly.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"There are three ways of removing a President under Ukrainian law: one is his death, the other is when he personally steps down, and the third is impeachment.",ukrainian
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"Moreover, I think this may be why they disbanded the Constitutional Court, which runs counter to all legal norms of both Ukraine and Europe.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,I would like to say here that the military exercises we recently held had nothing to do with the events in Ukraine.,ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"As you may know, we have a direct appeal from the incumbent and, as I said, legitimate President of Ukraine, Mr Yanukovych, asking us to use the Armed Forces to protect the lives, freedom and health of the citizens of Ukraine.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"We see the rampage of reactionary forces, nationalist and anti-Semitic forces going on in certain parts of Ukraine, including Kiev.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"When we see this we understand what worries the citizens of Ukraine, both Russian and Ukrainian, and the Russian-speaking population in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"Moreover, here is what I would like to say: we have always considered Ukraine not only a neighbour, but also a brotherly neighbouring republic, and will continue to do so.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"I am certain, and I stress, I am certain that the Ukrainian military and the Russian military will not be facing each other, they will be on the same side in a fight.",ukrainian
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"Therefore, I proceed from the idea that we will not have to do anything of the kind in eastern Ukraine.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"However, we firmly believe that all citizens of Ukraine, I repeat, wherever they live, should be given the same equal right to participate in the life of their country and in determining its future.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"If I were in the shoes of those who consider themselves the legitimate authorities, I would not waste time and go through all the necessary procedures, because they do not have a national mandate to conduct the domestic, foreign and economic policy of Ukraine, and especially to determine its future.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"As you may know, the stock market was jumpy even before the situation in Ukraine deteriorated.",ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,This is a general trend and it has nothing to do with Ukraine.,ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"As for the events in Ukraine, politics always influence the stock market in one way or another.",ukraine

910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,I would like to see those who would give that order in Ukraine.,ukraine
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"In other words, just about all engineering products are exported to Russia; the West is not buying any Ukrainian products.",ukrainian
910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"And to take all this and break it apart, to introduce European technical standards in the Ukrainian economy, which, thankfully or unfortunately, we are not using at the moment.",ukrainian

910,2014-03-04 15:40:00,"Essentially, what is needed now is to adopt a new constitution and put it to a referendum so that all of Ukraine’s citizens can take part in the process and influence the choice of basic principles that will form the foundations of their country’s government.",ukraine

931,2014-03-21 12:30:00,I think it is perfectly fair to raise the question of having Ukraine’s budget compensate these funds.,ukraine
931,2014-03-21 12:30:00,"Of course, these are tough measures, but at the same time, the agreement no longer has effect, but the money we paid is real, and our Ukrainian partners must understand that nobody hands over money just like that, for nothing.",ukrainian
931,2014-03-21 12:30:00,"At the same time, I remind you that Ukraine’s debt, public and corporate, to Russia is quite large as it is.",ukraine

931,2014-03-21 12:30:00,"The way things turned out, we gave Ukraine a discount on energy resources immediately after signing the agreement, that is, starting in 2010, but we acted in advance so to speak, because the use of the naval base was still covered by the old agreement until 2017.",ukraine
931,2014-03-21 12:30:00,"In other words, we gave Ukraine this money in advance.",ukraine
931,2014-03-21 12:30:00,"In principle, we could have chosen not to pay this money, but we did so, given that this was part of the new agreement’s terms, and it was also a way of helping Ukraine.",ukraine

949,2014-04-09 16:30:00,"But at the same time, given Ukraine’s complicated situation and the incompleteness of our negotiation process with the EU, I would like to ask the Cabinet and Gazprom to refrain for now from using these options, based on the contract, until further consultations are held – assuming, of course, that our partners agree to these consultations.",ukraine
949,2014-04-09 16:30:00,"The situation is certainly strange, to put it lightly, because, as you know, our partners in Europe recognise the legitimacy of today’s authorities in Kiev, but are not doing anything to support Ukraine – not a single dollar, not a single euro.",ukraine

953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,This also concerns the discount granted in December 2013 for the duration of three months due to the critical state of Ukraine’s economy.,ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"To this, we should add another 18.4 billion US dollars incurred by the Ukrainian side as a minimal take-or-pay fine.",ukrainian
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"In this manner, during the past four years Russia has been subsidizing Ukraine’s economy by offering slashed natural gas prices worth 35.4 billion US dollars.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"In addition, in December 2013, Russia granted Ukraine a loan of 3 billion US dollars.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,These very significant sums were directed towards maintaining the stability and creditability of the Ukrainian economy and preservation of jobs.,ukrainian
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"Instead of offering Ukraine real support, there is talk about a declaration of intent.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"The European Union is using Ukraine’s economy as a source of raw foodstuffs, metal and mineral resources, and at the same time, as a market for selling its highly-processed ready-made commodities (machine engineering and chemicals), thereby creating a deficit in Ukraine’s trade balance amounting to more than 10 billion US dollars.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,This comes to almost two-thirds of Ukraine’s overall deficit for 2013.,ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"To a large extent, the crisis in Ukraine’s economy has been precipitated by the unbalanced trade with the EU member states, and this, in turn has had a sharply negative impact on Ukraine’s fulfillment of its contractual obligations to pay for deliveries of natural gas supplied by Russia.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"However, Russia cannot and should not unilaterally bear the burden of supporting Ukraine’s economy by way of providing discounts and forgiving debts, and in fact, using these subsidies to cover Ukraine’s deficit in its trade with the EU member states.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,The debt of NAK Naftogaz Ukraine for delivered gas has been growing monthly this year.,ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"And even at that price, Ukraine did not pay a single dollar.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"In other words, only the volume of natural gas will be delivered to Ukraine as was paid for one month in advance of delivery.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,We fully realize that this increases the risk of siphoning off natural gas passing through Ukraine’s territory and heading to European consumers.,ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,We also realize that this may make it difficult for Ukraine to accumulate sufficient gas reserves for use in the autumn and winter period.,ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"In order to guarantee uninterrupted transit, it will be necessary, in the nearest future, to supply 11.5 billion cubic meters of gas that will be pumped into Ukraine’s underground storage facilities, and this will require a payment of about 5 billion US dollars.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"However, the fact that our European partners have unilaterally withdrawn from the concerted efforts to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, and even from holding consultations with the Russian side, leaves Russia no alternative.",ukrainian
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"We believe it is vital to hold, without delay, consultations at the level of ministers of economics, finances and energy in order to work out concerted actions to stabilize Ukraine’s economy and to ensure delivery and transit of Russian natural gas in accordance with the terms and conditions set down in the contract.",ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,It goes without saying that Russia is prepared to participate in the effort to stabilize and restore Ukraine’s economy.,ukraine
953,2014-04-10 23:00:00,"It is also essential to take into account the actual investments, contributions and expenditures that Russia has shouldered by itself alone for such a long time in supporting Ukraine.",ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,What is happening with my request to get to our European partners and gas customers the information that I set out in a letter following the meeting with Government members on the situation with our cooperation with Ukraine?,ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,"Seriously though, I’m obviously going to have to remind everyone that the formula we use to calculate the gas price was agreed in the official contract the Russia’s Gazprom signed with Ukraine’s Naftogaz in 2009.",ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,"In December 2013, as you know, we offered Ukraine a loan of $3 billion and discounted the gas price under condition that debts for 2013 be settled and that current payments be made on time.",ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,"What’s more, the lowest prices were in effect over the first quarter of this year, but even at this very lowest price our Ukrainian partners stopped making their payments.",ukrainian
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,It was for this reason that we appealed to our partners and friends in Europe in the hope that we can organise a meeting as soon as possible to work out ways of helping and supporting Ukraine's economy.,ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,Whoever really does care about Ukraine and the Ukrainian people should make their contribution to preventing the country’s economy from going bankrupt.,ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,That’s all not enough to keep the Ukrainian economy from slipping into total chaos.,ukrainian
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,"It means guarantees for banks that would be ready to lend to Ukraine, but there are no such banks and thus this amounts to no assistance at all.",ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,Let me say once again too that we have no plans or intention to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine.,ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,"What this means is that next month, Ukraine will receive only as much gas as it pays for this month.",ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,"You could take the relevant sections from the contract and send them to the European capitals as an appendix to my letter, all the more so as the contract long ago got ‘leaked’ anyway onto the internet during all the political battles in Ukraine.",ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,Even as big a company as Gazprom cannot bear the entire burden of subsidising Ukraine’s economy.,ukraine
956,2014-04-11 17:00:00,The problem is one of ensuring gas transit via Ukraine.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Before I answer your question, I’d like to go back a little to review recent events in Ukraine.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"No, he did not refuse to sign it, but said that he could not sign it on the EU conditions, because it would dramatically worsen the socioeconomic situation in Ukraine and affect Ukrainians.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"People in eastern and southeastern regions of Ukraine were worried about their future and the future of their children, because they saw a rapid growth of nationalist sentiments, heard threats and saw that [the new authorities] wanted to invalidate some of the ethnic minorities’ rights, including the rights of the Russian minority.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"On the other hand, this description is relative, because Russians are native persons in Ukraine.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Refusing to see that something was badly wrong in the Ukrainian state and to start a dialogue, the government threatened to use military force and even sent tanks and aircraft against civilians.",ukrainian
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"There are no Russian units in eastern Ukraine – no special services, no tactical advisors.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Quite to the contrary, we were going to build our relations with Ukraine based on current geopolitical realities.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"But we also thought, and have always hoped, that all native Russians, the Russian-speaking people living in Ukraine, would live in a comfortable political environment, that they would not be threatened or oppressed.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,You probably know better than anyone else in Russia that we had certain agreements with Ukraine on upgrading the fleet.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"But even if we are talking about relations between countries, I’m confident that we’ll find common ground with Ukraine and we’ll be there for one another.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,I hope that people in Ukraine will also understand that Russia could not do otherwise regarding Crimea.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,People living in Ukraine should respect the choice made by Crimean residents.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Second, Russia has always been close to Ukraine and will always remain closely related to it.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"I’m not talking about the assistance that Russia has been providing to Ukraine for many long years, and I’m sure that we’ll get back to that issue.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,We will seek to reach common ground with our Ukrainian partners.,ukrainian
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,We believe that all benefits and preferences that were available to Crimean residents in Ukraine should remain in place.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,And so we had to take the necessary measures in order to prevent the situation in Crimea unfolding the way it is now unfolding in southeastern Ukraine.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"After all, what happened to you and the way your colleagues are treated now in Kiev will come back to bite the Ukrainian state.",ukrainian
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,Is there a possibility of Russia reaching a compromise with the US on Ukraine?,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"A compromise should be reached by the various political forces in Ukraine, not third parties.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,The essential issue is how to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in the southeast of Ukraine.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"I would like to remind you that what was called Novorossiya (New Russia) back in the tsarist days – Kharkov, Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Nikolayev and Odessa – were not part of Ukraine back then.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,These territories were given to Ukraine in the 1920s by the Soviet government.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Today, they live in Ukraine, and they should be full citizens of their country.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Our role is to facilitate a solution in Ukraine, to ensure that there are guarantees.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"People from southeast Ukraine will ask you, will ask us and the current authorities in Kiev: “Fine, the elections will be held on May 25, but do you want us to recognise their outcome?",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"First, we must admit that the ethnic composition of Crimea differs from that of southeastern Ukraine.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"These territories, as I just said, were transferred to Ukraine in the mid-1920s, and in 1954, Crimea was annexed to Ukraine for some reason as well.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"As for what is happening in southeastern Ukraine, we don’t know for sure.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,Let me remind you that the Federation Council of Russia gave the President the right to use the Armed Forces in Ukraine.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"I very much hope that I will not have to exercise this right and that, through political and diplomatic means, we will be able to resolve all the pressing, if not to say burning, issues in Ukraine.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Of course, we need to maintain dialogue with both Moldova and Ukraine, to boost talks within the 5+2 format, which includes Moldova, Transnistria and five other states that are taking part in the settlement process.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,I think that the blockade should be lifted without delay; the residents of the republic are feeling its negative consequences both on the part of Moldova and Ukraine.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,Nationalist armed groups have already gathered on the border between Transnistria and Ukraine; such developments must be stopped without delay.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"The intention to split Russia and Ukraine, to separate what is essentially a single nation in many ways, has been an issue of international politics for centuries.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"If you recall the statements uttered by the White movement leaders, you’ll see that regardless their political disagreements with the Bolsheviks, they never had even the slightest thought about a possible division between Ukraine and Russia, as they always perceived them as part of a common, united space and a single nation.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,But I can’t agree that Ukraine is a damned land; please don't use this expression with regard to Ukraine.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,Ukraine is a long-suffering land; it’s a very complicated community and a long-suffering one in the direct sense of the word.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,Nationalism and even neo-Nazism are experiencing a resurgence in western Ukraine.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Central, eastern and southeastern Ukraine is another matter.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"They found themselves part of present-day Ukraine, which had been pieced together in the Soviet period.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Sergei, please, there is no need to ban your books from being published anywhere, including Ukraine.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,Our ministers continue relations with their Ukrainian counterparts.,ukrainian
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,And that’s to say nothing of the Ukrainian constitution.,ukrainian
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,Irina Khakamada had a question about the legitimacy of the election according to the Ukrainian constitution.,ukrainian
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Needless to say, first and foremost we wanted to support the residents of Crimea, but we also followed certain logic: If we don’t do anything, Ukraine will be drawn into NATO sometime in the future.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"I can tell you frankly – I think my former colleagues, the Ukrainian leaders, will not resent this: they told me candidly that they deliberately turned Crimea into a subsidised region by taking more money from it than from other regions to redistribute among other regions where the situation was especially difficult.",ukrainian
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"And the most dangerous part, of course, is transit via Ukraine with which we have tremendous difficulties in agreeing on energy problems.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"In Ukraine, for example, consumers used to pay around 30%-35%, but now they are paying less than 20%.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"With regard to Ukraine (I’ll use your question to talk about it), the current contract was signed in 2009.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Up until now, Ukraine has been paying us.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"The price formula which we expected Ukraine to use to pay for Russian gas hasn’t budged since the time this contract was signed in 2009 with Prime Minister Tymoshenko and her then Energy Minister, a gentleman with the telling name Prodan (he’s still the Minister of Energy)",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"In addition, with the sole purpose of supporting the economy of Ukraine, we agreed that the Russian Government would remove or reduce the export duty on gas supplies to Ukraine.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"Responding to our Ukrainian partners’ requests, we took another step in 2013 and loaned them $3 billion and even lowered the gas price to $268.5 per 1,000 cubic metres on the assumption, and based on the agreement, that they would pay us the arrears for the previous year which amount to about $1.5 billion, and would continue the regular current payments at reduced prices.",ukrainian
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"In January, they paid in full; in February, they paid less than half, and in March, the new Ukrainian government has not paid anything at all.",ukrainian
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"That Russia has a biased approach to Ukraine, and this is the political cost.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"We understand Ukraine’s difficulties, but we are asking you to join us in this work and take part in rescuing the Ukrainian economy.”",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,They promised Ukraine a billion.,ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"It's not the actual money, it’s just a guarantee to the banks that will agree to loan money to Ukraine.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"This means that Ukraine will need to pay us upfront for the next month, and we’ll send them as much gas as they paid for.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"I can agree about the supplies, but the transit is up to Ukraine.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"The contract I mentioned stipulates supplies to Ukraine at a price calculated according to the well-known formula – $485 per 1,000 cubic metres at the moment – and unimpeded transit of the Russian gas to Europe.",ukraine
961,2014-04-17 15:55:00,"What I mean is, it won’t be possible to go by the usual northern route because Ukraine will shut down railway service from the north of the peninsula.",ukraine
962,2014-04-17 16:15:00,"I very much hope that the efforts by the diplomats in Geneva today will yield results and allow our Ukrainian colleagues and friends throughout Ukraine’s entire territory, regardless of where they live, to reach a consensus to ensure the interests of all of Ukraine’s citizens, including, of course, the Russian-speaking and Russian population in southeast Ukraine.",ukraine
966,2014-04-19 21:00:00,We are not linking economic issues to the political developments in Ukraine.,ukraine
966,2014-04-19 21:00:00,"We do not want to either destabilise the Ukrainian economy or question the reliability of gas transit to Europe, therefore we call on all European states, all countries that are interested in supporting the Ukrainian economy to get involved in providing assistance to Ukraine and work out a set of measures designed to fund the budget.",ukraine
966,2014-04-19 21:00:00,This does not make much difference – Ukraine will have to find the rubles anyway.,ukraine
970,2014-04-24 14:20:00,"I would like to remind you that even the legitimate President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovich, did not use armed force in the conflict in Kiev; he did not resort to force even though he had been elected and had the national mandate to rule the country, even though he was Commander in Chief.",ukraine
970,2014-04-24 14:20:00,We would have had the same situation we now observe in the east and south of Ukraine.,ukraine
970,2014-04-24 14:20:00,"As for Crimea, as I have already said, we could have seen the same developments there as we see now in the east of Ukraine if we had not taken certain measures to protect the people’s interests in Crimea and Sevastopol.",ukraine
970,2014-04-24 14:20:00,"But we must fight for the interests of Russians, our compatriots, not just within our nation but abroad as well, including in Ukraine, the Baltics and other regions of the world.",ukraine
970,2014-04-24 14:20:00,"Given what is currently happening in eastern Ukraine, I very much count on Russia’s human rights organisations to give it their attention.",ukraine
970,2014-04-24 14:20:00,We have talked a lot about Ukraine today.,ukraine
971,2014-04-25 13:20:00,"Let me say a couple of words about cooperation with Ukraine, which has been a reliable military technology cooperation partner over many years now.",ukraine
971,2014-04-25 13:20:00,The serious state crisis Ukraine is currently going through has left its defence industry with practically no state support at all.,ukraine
971,2014-04-25 13:20:00,We all know very well that any potential disruption in these cooperation ties could be critical for Ukraine’s defence industry and for the people working in this sector and their families.,ukraine
971,2014-04-25 13:20:00,And yet it is in the interests of both Russia and Ukraine to preserve this research and development potential that we have built together.,ukraine
972,2014-04-28 15:40:00,"Our defence industry cooperation with our Ukrainian partners is very important for Russia’s defence sector, but it is of absolutely crucial importance for Ukraine’s defence industry.",ukraine
972,2014-04-28 15:40:00,Breaking ties with Russian partners would have a devastating effect on Ukraine’s defence industry though.,ukraine
972,2014-04-28 15:40:00,"I think this is an attempt to stop us from finding replacements for these imports and leaving us dependent on other companies, including the plants in Ukraine.",ukraine
972,2014-04-28 15:40:00,"On the question of Ukrainian specialists possibly moving to Russia, if they want to, we would help them settle in here and they would receive decent wages and housing, flats.",ukrainian
972,2014-04-28 15:40:00,"Ukraine has excellent potential in this respect, excellent specialists.",ukraine
975,2014-04-29 23:30:00,"But as for the second package of sanctions, it is not even clear exactly what they are all about, because they have no cause and effect link to what is happening now in Ukraine and in Russia.",ukraine
975,2014-04-29 23:30:00,"I think they are linked to the fact that our partners tried to settle the Ukrainian crisis using force, then realised what this leads to and are now looking for someone to blame.",ukrainian
975,2014-04-29 23:30:00,"This would mean that the authorities in Kiev would have to release from prison the people in whom Ukrainians have placed their trust and chosen as leaders, and would have to begin direct dialogue with these people.",ukrainian
975,2014-04-29 23:30:00,"It would mean equal respect too for the lawful rights of people in other parts of Ukraine, especially in the east and southeast of the country.",ukraine
975,2014-04-29 23:30:00,"Initially, the USA preferred to stay in the shadows, given that US interests converged to some extent with those of their European partners, seeing as the European Union, led by the European Commission, wanted to sign the agreements we know with Ukraine, agreements that I think did not offer advantageous terms for Ukraine.",ukraine
975,2014-04-29 23:30:00,"Some liked the idea, gave it their support, and probably a good number of people in Ukraine support it too, as we see.",ukraine
975,2014-04-29 23:30:00,"If the Ukrainian government or those who call themselves the government in Kiev invited observers, all the more so military observers, as experienced people they should realise they are heading for a conflict zone, entering a region that does not recognise the legitimacy of the current authorities in Kiev, and they should have been aware of this and reached agreement with the people who are in control of the situation in those regions.",ukrainian
980,2014-05-07 16:10:00,We have already discussed matters related to the grave and tragic events in Ukraine.,ukraine

981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,"Let me repeat once more that in Russia’s view, the blame for the crisis that emerged in Ukraine and is now taking the worst direction in its developments lies with those who organised the coup d’etat in Kiev on February 22–23, and have not yet taken the trouble to disarm right-wing radical and nationalist groups.",ukraine
981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,"We all have an interest in ending this crisis, Ukraine and its people above all.",ukraine
981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,Thus I say that we all want the crisis to end as soon as possible and in such a way that takes into account the interests of all people in Ukraine no matter where they live.,ukraine
981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,Russia urgently appeals to the authorities in Kiev to cease immediately all military and punitive operations in southeast Ukraine.,ukraine
981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,"We think the most important thing now is to launch direct dialogue, genuine, full-fledged dialogue between the Kiev authorities and representatives of southeast Ukraine.",ukraine
981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,This dialogue could give people from southeast Ukraine the chance to see that their lawful rights in Ukraine really will be guaranteed.,ukraine
981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,"In this context, we appeal too, to representatives of southeast Ukraine and supporters of federalisation to hold off the referendum scheduled for May 11, in order to give this dialogue the conditions it needs to have a chance.",ukraine
981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,"Let me stress that the presidential election the Kiev authorities plan to hold is a step in the right direction, but it will not solve anything unless all of Ukraine’s people first understand how their rights will be guaranteed once the election has taken place.",ukraine
981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,"In this respect, I hold the same position as Mr President, because we both believe that direct dialogue between the Kiev authorities and representatives of southeast Ukraine is the key to settling this crisis.",ukraine
981,2014-05-07 17:45:00,Russia is ready to contribute as it can to resolving the Ukrainian crisis and playing an active and positive part in the Geneva process.,ukrainian

983,2014-05-08 14:45:00,Primarily this needs to be done through establishing a direct and equal dialogue between the current authorities in Kiev and representatives of the southeastern regions of Ukraine.,ukraine

998,2014-05-16 15:00:00,"In this respect let me say that, as you know, the Soviet Union passed certain laws at the end of the 1980s, and the Russian Federation passed a law rehabilitating the repressed peoples in 1991, but the Crimean Tatar people was not included in this law because Crimea was part of Ukraine at that moment.",ukraine

1009,2014-05-21 15:40:00,"My view is that what is important is not the election itself but to organise relations with all of Ukraine’s regions so that people, whether in the west, south, east or north of the country all feel that they are full-fledged citizens, and so that ethnic minorities have full rights as citizens, including the right to use their native language.",ukraine
1009,2014-05-21 15:40:00,"In this context, in my view, given that the Ukrainian constitution still legally in force at this moment does not make it possible to hold an election when the country has a president, President Yanukovych, still legally in office – and I stress that in legal terms he is still the president in office – it would seem easier in this situation to first hold a referendum on all the basic issues, hold a referendum on the constitution and adopt it, and then on the basis of the new constitution elect a president and a parliament and form a government.",ukrainian

1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"However, I think that ultimately, this will be difficult for Ukraine, because it is unlikely in this case that its goods will be competitive even on the Russian market.",ukraine
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,I think that Ukraine’s leadership understands this.,ukraine
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"In addition to everything else, you know that we have special procedures for Ukrainian citizens to enter and stay in the Russian Federation; it is even more favourable than for the Eurasian Economic Union citizens who can stay in Russia for one month, but we make an exception for Ukraine: Ukrainian citizens can stay and essentially work in Russia for up to three months without having to register.",ukraine
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"After that, they don’t even leave, but simply send their passports to Ukraine, where they get stamped and sent back.",ukraine

1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,I think this needs to be done immediately: the counter-terrorism operation in southeast Ukraine must be stopped immediately.,ukraine
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,But nobody invited representatives from southeast Ukraine.,ukraine
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,The presidential elections in Ukraine are over and the fight for the presidency is complete.,ukraine
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"I think the Ukrainian leadership must show goodwill – or, if you will, demonstrate government wisdom.",ukrainian
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"You see, when, for example, the “Right Sector” – the unofficial armed formation – gets involved in the hostilities, takes its own men and executes Ukrainian army soldiers in the field on a ‘no trial, no record’ basis, simply because they refused to shoot at the people or, they occupy a hospital and execute the wounded there, can this be called normal conditions for beginning the negotiation process?",ukrainian
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"No, Mr Poroshenko and I did not discuss gas prices, but I know that Gazprom and its Ukrainian partners are close to finalising agreements.",ukrainian
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"It is not out of the question that we could meet the Ukrainians halfway, support them, provided, of course, that they pay the debts that have accumulated recently.",ukrainian
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"But there is one fact that all of us, including our European friends and partners, must take into account: the risk of non-payment remains very high, and if somebody thinks that they can resolve the problems of Ukrainian energy supply through reverse supplies, they are deeply mistaken.",ukrainian
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"Moreover, the high risk of non-payment remains, given that Ukraine’s economy is in a tight situation and these risks of non-payment will then fully fall onto the shoulders of our European partners.",ukraine
1049,2014-06-11 16:00:00,"The first remark concerns the energy talks we have been holding with our Ukrainian partners, talks that have not been easy.",ukrainian
1049,2014-06-11 16:00:00,"Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Gazprom CEO are meeting with our Ukrainian partners, with European Commissioner Mr Oettinger acting as intermediary.",ukrainian
1049,2014-06-11 16:00:00,"Gazprom has proposed our Ukrainian partners exactly the same conditions as it offered Viktor Yanukovych’s government: a discount on the contract price of $100, which makes a final price of $385 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas.",ukrainian
1049,2014-06-11 16:00:00,"As we understand the situation, our Ukrainian partners are worried that this discount could be unilaterally cancelled as easily as it was offered.",ukrainian
1049,2014-06-11 16:00:00,But I nevertheless ask the Government and the Prime Minister to look at what could be done at the government level or through our agreements with the Ukrainian government to cement these conditions and make them absolutely reliable and unchanging for an agreed period.,ukrainian
1049,2014-06-11 16:00:00,"The issue is that our Ukrainian partners find these discounts insufficient and want more, though it is not very clear on what grounds.",ukrainian
1049,2014-06-11 16:00:00,I think that our offer is made in a more than genuine spirit of partnership aimed to help and support the Ukrainian economy as it traverses this difficult time.,ukrainian
1049,2014-06-11 16:00:00,"In order to support Ukraine’s economy and, to be honest, in order not to lose a customer, which is also important, we will act as we propose to our customers, that is to say, we will be open, honest, and as transparent as possible in our actions.",ukraine
1054,2014-06-17 14:40:00,Now Ukrainian prices are higher everywhere?,ukrainian
1057,2014-06-22 12:30:00,I think that what is happening in Ukraine is an immense tragedy.,ukraine
1057,2014-06-22 12:30:00,"It is important that this ceasefire open the way to a dialogue between all of the parties to the combat, so as to find solutions that will be acceptable to all sides, in order to ensure that people in southeast Ukraine have no doubt that they are an integral part of the country, have the same rights as all other citizens, and know that these rights are guaranteed, including by Ukraine’s constitution.",ukraine
1057,2014-06-22 12:30:00,"Unfortunately, objective monitoring shows that military operations have not ended, and just last night there was quite active artillery fire on the Ukrainian side.",ukrainian

1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"Mr President and I have also discussed in detail burning international issues, including – and my colleague has just spoken of this – the dramatic developments in Ukraine.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"At the same time, we certainly support the intention of the Ukrainian authorities and of President Poroshenko not only to declare a truce, but also to achieve results.",ukrainian
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"This will undoubtedly serve the cause of resolving complicated conflicts, including the one in Ukraine.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"Mr President Putin, the European Union is trying to use sanctions to correct its policy in Ukraine, to encourage Ukraine to follow a different policy.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,Do you view Austria as an ally in the fight for Ukraine?,ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"I told Mr President and can tell you about it, we also said this to the Ukrainian side, including President Poroshenko: declaring a ceasefire is not enough.",ukrainian
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"If we hear or continue to hear that we have seven days and we must disarm within those seven days of ceasefire, but not a single attempt is made during that period to reach a substantive agreement with east Ukraine, then all the efforts will be for nothing and there will be no results.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"But if we see that substantive talks have begun, so that people in east Ukraine can finally understand how their legal interests will be guaranteed, then there is a high chance of success.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"I am very pleased and happy to note that yesterday, the first direct contact between authorities in Kiev and representatives from southeast Ukraine in Donetsk and Lugansk occurred.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,The part of your question regarding my letter to the upper chamber of the Russian parliament asking to cancel the resolution empowering the President of Russia to use the Armed Forces on Ukraine’s territory.,ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"Yes, I will not deny, as I have already said, that we used our military units to guarantee the free expression of will by the people of Crimea; we blocked the activities of some Ukrainian army units so that they did not get involved in the process of expression of will, and to ensure there were no victims.",ukrainian
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"The best approach is not to demand disarmament, especially from the eastern part of Ukraine, especially while radical forces such as the “Right Sector” and the like are still not disarmed, although they have talked about it many times and promised that these unlawful formations will lay down their arms.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,That is why I called on the upper chamber of the Russian parliament to revoke the resolution on the right to use the Armed Forces in Ukraine.,ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,But I count on the peace process to develop in the direction of resolving issues concerning the lawful rights of citizens living in the eastern part of Ukraine.,ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"Of course, we will always protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine and the part of the Ukrainian population, the Ukrainian people, who feel not just an ethnic but also a cultural connection to Russia, who feel themselves part of the greater Russian community.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"First of all, we are not laying down any preliminary conditions during the talks between the authorities from Kiev and east Ukraine, mainly because Russia is not a party to this conflict.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"We believe, and it is impossible to avoid it, that talks need to be launched on the future structure of Ukraine itself and ensuring the rights, the lawful rights and interests of the people living in southeast Ukraine.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"People in central and western Ukraine took up arms, while people in the east said, “Well, if they can take up arms, why can’t we?”",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"Incidentally, answering your Austrian colleague’s question, I can say that this is not about a desire to bypass Ukraine.",ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,And what about Nord Stream – was that an attempt to bypass Ukraine?,ukraine
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,Is that an attempt to bypass Ukraine?,ukraine

1067,2014-06-27 13:45:00,We are particularly concerned about the situation in Ukraine.,ukraine
1067,2014-06-27 13:45:00,The anti-constitutional coup in Kiev and attempts to force the Ukrainian people into an artificial choice between Europe and Russia have pushed society into division and painful internal confrontation.,ukrainian

1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,We need to understand clearly that the events provoked in Ukraine are the concentrated outcome of the notorious deterrence policy.,ukraine
1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,"In Ukraine, as you may have seen, at threat were our compatriots, Russian people and people of other nationalities, their language, history, culture and legal rights, guaranteed, by the way, by European conventions.",ukraine

1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,I would like to stress that what happened in Ukraine was the climax of the negative tendencies in international affairs that had been building up for years.,ukraine

1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,"We also failed to agree to make public the statement approved by the foreign ministers of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine on the need to maintain peace and search for mutually acceptable solutions.",ukraine

1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,We strongly hope that the Ukrainian authorities act on their promises to carefully investigate the crimes.,ukrainian

1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,"Thus, the Kiev court authorities admit that they have done everything right not only by international law, but by Ukrainian law as well.",ukrainian
1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,"As of June 16, as you may know, we have transferred Ukraine to a pre-payment system, so they will get exactly the amount of gas they pay for.",ukraine
1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,The main thing is that honest gas consumers and suppliers should not suffer from the actions of Ukrainian politicians and bureaucrats.,ukrainian
1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,"Generally, all of us – Ukraine, our European partners, and we – should seriously consider how to reduce the probability of any type of political or economic risks or force majeure situations on the continent.",ukraine

1102,2014-07-17 03:30:00,"But unfortunately, we are not seeing this on the part of our partners, first and foremost our American partners who, on the contrary, it seems to me, are pushing Ukraine’s current authorities toward continuing a fratricidal war and continuing retributive operations.",ukraine

1102,2014-07-17 03:30:00,"This, I believe, is exactly what is happening in Ukraine with the first tranche.",ukraine
1102,2014-07-17 03:30:00,From what I know most of this funding was transferred to banks privately owned by Ukrainian oligarchs.,ukrainian
1102,2014-07-17 03:30:00,"Where is this money now, what happened to it, whose pockets did it end up in – this is something the IMF and the general public in Ukraine and in the countries supporting it should find out.",ukraine
1102,2014-07-17 03:30:00,"Apart from everything else, part of the first tranche of the funding was meant to be used to pay for Ukraine’s commitments under foreign trade contracts.",ukraine

1180,2014-09-22 15:45:00,"Yes, you should certainly continue this work, all the more so as Russian banks hold more than 30 percent of the market in Ukraine’s banking sector, and if we pull out of this market this would indeed be an added and quite serious blow to Ukraine’s economy.",ukraine

1221,2014-10-17 21:00:00,The second part of the problem has to do with the law that was recently signed by the President of Ukraine.,ukraine
1221,2014-10-17 21:00:00,That progress pertains to our agreement with our Ukrainian partners on the conditions for renewing gas supplies to Ukraine (at least for the winter period) and on all the parameters for this agreement.,ukraine
1221,2014-10-17 21:00:00,"The problem is that, as you know, we issued Ukraine a loan at the end of last year worth 3 billion dollars.",ukraine

1221,2014-10-17 21:00:00,But I want to point out that it’s not just Russian citizens fighting in Ukraine.,ukraine
1221,2014-10-17 21:00:00,"All this adds up, according to our estimates, to $5.5 billion, if we take the price Ukraine was to pay for April, May and June at $485.",ukraine

1221,2014-10-17 21:00:00,"I believe that in this situation our European partners should, as I have already said, lend Ukraine a helping hand.",ukraine
1221,2014-10-17 21:00:00,The amount in question is minute compared to what we have lent Ukraine.,ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"Ukraine, which I’m sure was discussed at length and which we will discuss some more, is one of the example of such sorts of conflicts that affect international power balance, and I think it will certainly not be the last.",ukraine

1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"We didn’t even say anything about politics; we spoke only about the economy, saying that such steps, made without any prior arrangements, touch on the interests of many other nations, including Russia as Ukraine’s main trade partner, and that a wide discussion of the issues is necessary.",ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"Because in implementing Ukraine’s association project, our partners would come to us with their goods and services through the back gate, so to speak, and we did not agree to this, nobody asked us about this.",ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"We had discussions on all topics related to Ukraine’s association with the EU, persistent discussions, but I want to stress that this was done in an entirely civilised manner, indicating possible problems, showing the obvious reasoning and arguments.",ukraine

1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"The decision to hold the referendum was made by the legitimate authority of Crimea – its Parliament, elected a few years ago under Ukrainian law prior to all these grave events.",ukrainian

1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"However, neither is the Ukrainian army withdrawing from the locations they should leave, nor is the militia army withdrawing from the settlements they have to move out of, referring, and I will be frank now – to the fact that their families remain there (I mean the militia) and they fear for their safety.",ukrainian
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"When people in southeast Ukraine did not like it, they tried to elect their own bodies of government and management and they were arrested and taken to prison in Kiev at night.",ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"You see, under the circumstances, it is very difficult for us in Russia to arrange work with people in southeast Ukraine in a way that would induce them to fully comply with all the agreements.",ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"I would like to stress that we are for the full implementation of the agreements by both parties, and the most important thing I want to say – and I want everyone to hear that – if, God forbid, anyone is again tempted to use force for the final settlement of the situation in southeast Ukraine, this will bring the situation to a complete deadlock.",ukraine

1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"The Minsk agreements do stipulate that elections in the southeast should be held in coordination with Ukrainian legislation, not under Ukrainian law, but in coordination with it.",ukrainian
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"This was done on purpose, because nobody in the southeast wants to hold elections in line with Ukrainian law.",ukrainian
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"How can this be done, when there is shooting every day, people get killed on both sides and they have to hold elections under Ukrainian law?",ukrainian
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"They spoke of the date of the elections in the southeast, but few know that there has been an agreement that elections in southeast Ukraine should be held by November 3.",ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"If Ukraine wants to keep its territorial integrity, and this is something we want as well, they need to understand that there is no sense in holding on to some village or other — this is pointless.",ukraine

1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"I will be frank; we used our Armed Forces to block Ukrainian units stationed in Crimea, but not to force anyone to take part in the elections.",ukrainian

1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"Do you think that Ukraine has the right to exist as a sovereign and independent state, and is it indeed a real country?",ukraine

1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,But it is another matter that the historical process that saw Ukraine take shape in its present borders was quite a complex one.,ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"In 1921–22, when the Soviet Union was formed, this territory was transferred from Russia to Ukraine.",ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"The communists had a simple logic: their goal was to increase the share of proletariat in Ukraine so as to ensure they had more support in various political processes, because in the communists’ view, the peasantry was a petty bourgeois group that was hostile to their aims, and so they needed to create a bigger proletariat.",ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"Second, what also happened I think is that during the Civil War, nationalist groups in Ukraine tried to seize these regions but didn’t succeed, and the Bolsheviks told their supporters in Ukraine: Look what you can show the Ukrainian people.",ukraine
1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"In 1954, Khrushchev, who liked to bang his shoe at the UN, decided for some reason to transfer Crimea to Ukraine.",ukraine

1227,2014-10-24 19:00:00,"In this respect it is difficult not to recognise that Ukraine is a complex, multi-component state formation.",ukraine

1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,We did not bring about the crisis in Ukraine.,ukraine
1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,"There was no need to support, as I have said many times, the anti-state, anti-constitutional takeover that eventually led to a sharp resistance on the territory of Ukraine, to a civil war in fact.",ukraine

1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,"This requires a resolution of the Supreme Rada – the Ukrainian Parliament, which is also covered in the Minsk agreements.",ukrainian
1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,"If the current authorities in Kiev believe that this is Ukrainian territory inhabited by Ukrainian citizens who have the right to receive, say, disability benefits or the pensions that they earned under the existing Ukrainian law, the Kiev authorities cannot refuse to pay, they simply have no right to do so.",ukrainian
1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,This is true of eastern Ukraine as well.,ukraine
1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,"Regarding cooperation, we have always said and continue to say – there is nothing new here – that with all the current difficulties, I have always thought that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, one ethnic group, at least; each with their own peculiarities and cultural characteristics, but with a common history, a common culture and common spiritual roots.",ukrainian
1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,"Whatever happens, in the long run Russia and Ukraine are doomed to a common future.",ukraine
1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,"We have proceeded right from the start from the idea that Ukraine has the right to make its own choice – civilizational, political, economic or any other.",ukraine
1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,"However, apart from the ties I mentioned earlier, ones that took shape over decades, very specific things in the present hold Russia and Ukraine together: we have a common engineering infrastructure, a common energy infrastructure, a common transportation infrastructure, common regulations and so on and so forth.",ukraine
1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,How did the crisis in Ukraine that you began with occur: Ukraine was offered to sign the association agreement.,ukraine
1526,2015-06-19 16:45:00,"However, everyone knows that Ukraine is a member of the free trade zone within the CIS (which Ukraine, actually, wanted to get established).",ukraine

1545,2015-07-03 18:45:00,What I mean here is that those who are imposing these restrictive measures and so-called sanctions on Russia are in fact responsible for the events that we are now witnessing in southeast Ukraine.,ukraine
1564,2015-07-10 16:20:00,"Second, with regard to whether we discussed this issue or not – some of our colleagues asked us about Ukraine without going too deep into the issue, and we gave them our vision of the situation the way that we see it.",ukraine
1564,2015-07-10 16:20:00,"However, we all agree on one thing – there is no way to resolve the Ukraine crisis other than peacefully by fully and unconditionally complying with the Minsk agreements.",ukraine

1618,2015-09-04 06:50:00,"As for the tragic events that took place, I think this is not linked to amendments to the Constitution, because everything proposed today as amendments is purely declarative in nature and essentially changes nothing in the way state power in Ukraine is organised.",ukraine
1618,2015-09-04 06:50:00,"Simply, what we are seeing today is the next round of political confrontation in Ukraine, and the amendments to the Constitution are being used only as a pretext for intensifying the political battle for power.",ukraine

2187,2016-10-12 16:30:00,I cannot sign the amnesty law adopted by the Rada; I just cannot do this for the Ukrainian President.,ukrainian

2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,Regarding the question of whether Ukraine is delivering on its commitments.,ukraine
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"In general, regarding sanctions against Russia, no matter whether introduced over developments in southeastern Ukraine or in Syria, I can tell you that the goal of those who formulate and advocate this policy is not to settle a specific problem, for example, in southeastern Ukraine, but to contain Russia.",ukraine
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"Even without Ukraine, they would have found some other pretext.",ukraine
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,"This dependency is gradually fading, not only with regard to Ukrainian suppliers, but other countries as well, including European countries and the US.",ukrainian

2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,But our Ukrainian partners have only to say the word and we will be ready to involve Ukrainian industry in the effort to meet our consumption demands.,ukrainian
2196,2016-10-16 14:30:00,This includes joint cooperation to modernise Ukraine’s defence enterprises and civilian sectors.,ukraine
2202,2016-10-20 02:20:00,First on the Minsk Agreements: all the participants in today's meeting agreed that a settlement in south-eastern Ukraine should be based on the Minsk Agreements and we all confirmed our commitment to these agreements.,ukraine
2208,2016-10-26 17:10:00,"Incidentally, Ukraine has an excellent centre here.",ukraine
2208,2016-10-26 17:10:00,"I said right from the start that they can use it, that no one will take anything away from them, and that it will belong to the Ukrainian Paralympic family.",ukrainian
2208,2016-10-26 17:10:00,I said that the centre should remain in Ukraine’s hands.,ukraine
2208,2016-10-26 17:10:00,It is good to have our Paralympians know that there is nothing that could be a cause of contention in their relations with their friends in Ukraine.,ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"As you know, the Minsk agreements, which I think the experts have all read, say in black and white: “Thirty days after the signing of the Minsk agreements Ukraine’s Rada must adopt a resolution outlining the geographical boundaries of areas where the law on the special status of these unrecognised republics would become effective immediately.”",ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"It was passed, I would like to remind you, by the Parliament of Ukraine.",ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"But after passing this resolution, Ukraine and its Parliament adopted an amendment, a paragraph to Article 9 or 10, which said the law would take effect only after municipal elections in these areas.",ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"I repeat, in our opinion, that law is absolutely key to a political resolution to the crisis in southeastern Ukraine.",ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,But the Ukrainian president said that this was not possible and everything ended up in a dead end.,ukrainian
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"But then in Berlin, the Ukrainian president suddenly also attempted to change this proposal, already the result of a compromise.",ukrainian
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"I have always considered, and still do today, that Russians and Ukrainians are really one people.",ukrainian
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,There are people who hold radical nationalist views both in Russia and in Ukraine.,ukraine

2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"We are concerned about what is happening now with this very important energy component in Ukraine because in our opinion, in the opinion of our specialists – and they are no worse than Ukrainian experts because in Soviet times this was a single complex – we do realise what is going on there.",ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,I discussed gas shipments to Ukraine with the Ukrainian President at his initiative.,ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,We will provide timely and guaranteed energy supplies for Ukrainian consumers for the amount of this advance payment.,ukrainian
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"But today the price for Ukraine – and we had agreed on this before and said so last year – will not be higher than the price for its neighbours, for instance, Poland.",ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,We could sell gas to Ukraine for $180.,ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,I have reason to believe that the middlemen in these reverse deals are close to certain executives in Ukraine’s fuel and energy complex.,ukraine
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,They did this at the request of our Ukrainian partners.,ukrainian
2209,2016-10-27 20:00:00,"But I think, as I have already said, that even if these problems linked with Ukraine, its south-east, Crimea and Syria had not existed, something else would have been found to deter Russia.",ukraine
2223,2016-11-04 14:30:00,"This choice was the common spiritual source for the peoples of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, and laid the foundations of our moral standards and value priorities which continue to define our lives to this day.",ukraine
2254,2016-11-23 16:40:00,"I cannot say anything about these measures yet and can say only what we know at present, which is that these military servicemen formerly served in the Ukrainian armed forces and, after Crimea’s reunification with Russia, decided to serve in the Russian armed forces.",ukrainian
2254,2016-11-23 16:40:00,"In this respect, let me say first of all that we have always had great respect for and trust in Ukrainian military service personnel, and therefore proposed that they continue their service in our ranks.",ukrainian
2254,2016-11-23 16:40:00,"Second, they wanted to obtain confirmation of education at one of Ukraine’s higher education establishments, and this was why they went to the border.",ukraine
2254,2016-11-23 16:40:00,"If people in Ukraine think they can win Crimea residents’ sympathy this way, this amounts to an attack using inappropriate means, to use legal language.",ukraine
2285,2016-12-13 11:00:00,Due to the events in Ukraine or in Syria?,ukraine
2285,2016-12-13 11:00:00,"However, Japan and Russian-Japanese relations are hardly related to the events in Syria or in Ukraine.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"I hope, no, I am sure that we will eventually normalise relations with Ukraine, and this bridge will be very important for the development of Russian-Ukrainian trade and cultural ties.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,Another colleague has a poster with ‘Ukraine’ written on it.,ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"It would be good to begin by making sure that the Ukrainian army is not viewed as an occupying force in Donbass, which is Ukrainian territory.",ukrainian
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"In fact, Ukrainian authorities consider the detention of people in Donbass to be illegal.",ukrainian
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"At the same time, there are many people imprisoned in Ukraine whom the Ukrainian authorities consider to be lawfully convicted, and refuse to put them on the exchange lists.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"Regarding the detained Ukrainian military service personnel and military intelligence officers, no one tortured or beat them.",ukrainian
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"As for visa-free travel to Europe for Ukrainian citizens, I fully support it.",ukrainian
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"So if Ukraine, Ukrainian citizens are allowed to travel to Europe visa-free, I think it would be a step in the right direction.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"So the question is, will the inflow of Ukrainian workers increase anyway?",ukrainian
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"In Russia, according to preliminary data alone, there are 3 million Ukrainians.",ukrainian
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"If they can go to Europe without a visa and earn a little more, people will certainly try to move there, even from Russia, let alone from Ukraine.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"On the other hand, there might be negative implications for Ukraine as well.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"Without the right to work, Ukrainians coming to work in Europe will find themselves in a very humiliating position.",ukrainian
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"This means that they will have to work illegally, that is, they will arrive, say, for three months under the visa-free agreement, then go back to Ukraine, check in and go back immediately.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"This means that even now, with peak loads, especially in winter, Crimea consumes 1,200–1,300 megawatts, of which 800 megawatts were formerly supplied by Ukraine.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"This resulted in the people living in Crimea wanting to reunite with Russia, Ukraine losing Crimea, and the sad, tragic and bloody events in Donbass.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"It’s amazing to think, but at the start of this whole tragedy was the failure to reach agreements on Ukraine’s accession to, of all things, an association agreement with the European Union.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,Now we are talking about visa-free travel for Ukrainian citizens.,ukrainian
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"But it is on hold, and if it proceeds, it will be implemented in the truncated form and, obviously, will put labour migrants coming from Ukraine to Europe in a completely embarrassing position.",ukraine
2299,2016-12-23 15:55:00,"Whether we are talking about Ukraine or Georgia, I believe that everyone should travel visa-free.",ukraine
2322,2017-01-17 16:20:00,"There are certain risks for us, similar to the risks that we faced after a similar document was signed between Ukraine and the European Union.",ukraine
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"I briefed our colleagues in detail on our view regarding events in eastern Ukraine, and in the Middle East, including in Syria.",ukraine
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"By the way, we do not have any political goals when it comes to gas transit through Ukraine.",ukraine
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"If it is economically viable and safe, we do not rule out the possibility of moving some gas through Ukraine as well.",ukraine
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"Our position is, in fact, known: it was provoked by the Ukrainian side.",ukrainian
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"On Sunday, the so-called Ukrainian voluntary units captured an opposition stronghold and moved 200 metres into the territory controlled by the militias.",ukrainian
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"First, the Ukrainian leadership needs money, and the best way to drum up some money is to go to the European Union, individual countries of Europe, the United States, or international financial institutions, posing as a victim of aggression.",ukrainian
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"Second, as we all know, during the presidential campaign in the United States, the Ukrainian government adopted a unilateral position in favour of one candidate.",ukrainian
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"Now they need to improve relations with the current administration, and using a conflict to do so is always a better, easier way to draw the incumbent administration into addressing Ukrainian problems and thus establish a dialogue.",ukrainian
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,I think that the current Ukrainian government is not at all willing to implement the Minsk agreements and is just looking for an excuse not to do so.,ukrainian
2342,2017-02-02 18:50:00,"I very much hope that sensible people in Ukraine, as well as those who are interested in addressing such issues through political means, will not allow the situation in southeastern Ukraine to follow the worst-case scenario, but will instead concentrate all their attention and efforts on complying with the Minsk agreements.",ukraine
2351,2017-02-10 14:50:00,"Of course, we will also speak about economic cooperation today, but I would like to use this opportunity to speak, as the President of a country that is an EU and NATO member, about what can be done to bring about peace in Ukraine, ease hostilities and build up confidence, including between Russia and the EU as a whole.",ukraine
2352,2017-02-10 17:15:00,"I have informed the President of the latest developments and the aggravation of the situation in southeastern Ukraine, highlighting the Minsk agreements that have absolutely no alternative as a basis for resolving the conflict.",ukraine
2352,2017-02-10 17:15:00,"They may be a little different, but we remained committed to the idea of respecting and implementing all the decisions to resolve the situation in eastern Ukraine.",ukraine
2357,2017-02-16 13:50:00,We also see the recent serious flare-up in southeast Ukraine.,ukraine
2357,2017-02-16 13:50:00,The current Ukrainian authorities are obviously not seeking a peaceful solution to this very complex problem and have decided to opt for the use of force instead.,ukrainian
2405,2017-03-22 16:00:00,"What’s more, we are ready to continue relations with all partners, including Ukraine, as transit countries, but we take the position that there will be reliable and economically advantageous market conditions for this cooperation.",ukraine
2419,2017-03-30 15:40:00,"First of all, thank you for the fact that in raising this issue, when you spoke of the problem with Ukraine and Crimea, you made a distinction between Ukraine and Crimea.",ukraine
2419,2017-03-30 15:40:00,"Now, regarding Ukraine, we know that in the USA and some other places, some hold the view that the worse the relations between Russia and Ukraine, the better it is for them, because it weakens Russia and hampers whichever integration processes that would strengthen Russia, including economically.",ukraine
2419,2017-03-30 15:40:00,"We know that this was one of the motivations and reasons for the coup d'état in Ukraine, our neighbour.",ukraine
2419,2017-03-30 15:40:00,We also know that these events have plunged Ukraine into chaos.,ukraine
2435,2017-04-11 15:45:00,"We also spoke about other issues, including the Ukrainian issue.",ukrainian
2435,2017-04-11 15:45:00,"Of course, we also discussed Ukraine.",ukraine
2435,2017-04-11 15:45:00,"In our view, no one – neither Russia, nor Europe nor Ukraine – can benefit in any way from continuing instability in the heart of Europe.",ukraine
2441,2017-04-14 12:20:00,"This would liberalise and improve problem solving in the transit of goods from third countries, including Ukraine.",ukraine
2453,2017-04-25 15:50:00,"You know, we were buying such engines in Ukraine before 2014.",ukraine
2454,2017-04-25 18:30:00,"We have created what is essentially a new school of research and an innovative branch of marine engine production, which did not exist in Russia before, since we were buying everything from Ukraine.",ukraine

2468,2017-04-28 15:15:00,"Our top priorities include identifying and interdicting illegal drug supplies from Central Asia and synthetic drug supplies of European, Ukrainian, and Asian origin, and moving swiftly to put a stop to the activities of drug dealers and associated organised criminal groups, including transnational ones.",ukrainian

2471,2017-05-02 16:15:00,"We will also talk about international affairs: the situations in Ukraine, Syria, and Libya.",ukraine
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Federal Chancellor for coming to Sochi and for the opportunity to have a meaningful conversation on preparations for the upcoming July G20 meeting in Hamburg, and review urgent matters on the bilateral agenda, as well as exchange views on current international issues, including the Syria crisis and the situation in Ukraine.",ukraine
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"At a recent restricted format meeting, as I already said, we spoke about the situation in Ukraine, which causes serious concern.",ukraine
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"The Normandy Four, undoubtedly, should continue dealing with the Ukrainian crisis.",ukrainian
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"As you may recall – and I am compelled to mention this – three years ago today, a horrible tragedy took place in Odessa, when Ukrainian nationalists forced helpless people into the Trade Union House and burned them alive.",ukrainian
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"First, regarding the events in southeastern Ukraine – this is the result of a coup, an unconstitutional change of power in Kiev.",ukraine
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"Secondly, no one has separated these territories; they are being separated by the Ukrainian authorities themselves, which set up all kinds of blockades.",ukrainian
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"I draw your attention to the fact that Russia is still supplying a significant amount of goods, including energy, and coking coal for the Ukrainian metallurgical industry.",ukrainian
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"However, the Ukrainian authorities are the ones responsible for the blockade of these territories.",ukrainian
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"It is that the Kiev authorities have essentially withdrawn the national currency of Ukraine – the hryvnia – from circulation, and people in these republics, these territories, had no other choice but to introduce alternatives.",ukraine
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"But since these enterprises, which are located on the territory of the unrecognised republics, have been denied the ability – and I want to emphasise this – to obtain raw materials from Ukrainian territory, or ship products to Ukrainian territory, people who work at these enterprises – so as not to be left without the means to survive – had no choice but to introduce temporary management.",ukrainian
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"Banks do not operate there, and the Ukrainian financial system does not operate there on the initiative of the current Kiev authorities.",ukrainian
2472,2017-05-02 17:00:00,"Our partners in Europe said some time ago that they are ready to help the Ukrainian authorities to ensure the normal functioning of financial institutions, at least temporary ones.",ukrainian
2497,2017-05-17 14:40:00,"We discussed current issues on the international and regional agendas, of course, and looked at the crisis situations in Syria, Libya, Ukraine, and on the Korean Peninsula.",ukraine
2497,2017-05-17 14:40:00,"Of course, this strategic partnership should not be suspended because of the crisis involving Ukraine.",ukraine
2514,2017-05-29 18:40:00,We also spoke about the Ukrainian crisis and opportunities for solving the Syrian issue.,ukrainian
2514,2017-05-29 18:40:00,You wanted to know how sanctions on Russia could help overcome the crisis in southeastern Ukraine.,ukraine
2519,2017-05-31 08:00:00,"Progress in resolving any conflict, including the conflict in southeast Ukraine, can be achieved first and foremost by the conflicting parties.",ukraine
2519,2017-05-31 08:00:00,This conflict is internal – a Ukrainian conflict primarily.,ukrainian
2519,2017-05-31 08:00:00,The Ukrainian authorities say this cannot be done because of the shooting there.,ukrainian
2519,2017-05-31 08:00:00,"The second goal in the political sphere is to put into practice, at long last, the law on the special status of these regions, which the Ukrainian parliament has adopted.",ukrainian

2528,2017-06-02 17:10:00,It is an important issue because it is the Ukraine crisis that lies at the root of today’s problems and sanctions.,ukraine

2545,2017-06-15 16:00:00,"He is, of course, an ardent supporter of Ukraine’s independence but his belief system is based on fundamental treatises of those whom we can hypothetically describe as Ukrainian nationalists and who wrote their treatises in the 19th century and later on.",ukraine
2545,2017-06-15 16:00:00,All of them – I would like to emphasise that all of them proceeded from the premise that Ukraine should be independent but as a federal state.,ukraine
2545,2017-06-15 16:00:00,"Moreover, one of them wrote that excessive, “mechanical” centralisation, as he put it, would lead to internal conflicts in Ukraine and this is, actually, what we are witnessing today.",ukraine

2545,2017-06-15 16:00:00,"Yes, he is involved in the exchange of detainees, prisoners of war, if we could call them that, and he is doing this on instructions from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.",ukrainian
2545,2017-06-15 16:00:00,"Further, at that point, the regions that are considered Ukraine today were Russia’s regions, and if the President of today's Ukraine quotes Lermontov as saying that he is leaving for some other place, Lermontov referred to entire Russia, including the areas that today are known as Ukraine.",ukraine
2545,2017-06-15 16:00:00,"In fact, most likely, Mr Poroshenko wanted to show his voters that he is delivering on his promise by making a civilisational choice, as the Ukrainian leadership puts it, by leading the country towards Europe.",ukrainian

3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,It was done by the Ukrainian army during a drill.,ukrainian
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,And the first reaction of the Ukrainian officials was that Ukraine had nothing to do with it.,ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,Ukraine flatly denied its involvement in that terrible incident but had to admit it later.,ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,And why should we believe Ukrainian officials?,ukrainian
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,The first thing we did when the events in Ukraine began… What kind of events?,ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"You do not have to be an expert on Ukraine; you just need to be an expert on law, on the constitutional law of any country.",ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"When the unconstitutional armed coup took place in Ukraine, and power changed hands by force, our army was legally deployed in Crimea – under the agreement on our military base there.",ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"But, when unconstitutional actions in Ukraine began to unfold, when people in Crimea felt danger, when trains started bringing aggressive nationalists there, when buses and personal vehicles were blocked, people naturally wanted to protect themselves.",ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,And the first thing that occurred was to restore the rights that Ukraine itself had issued by granting Crimea autonomy.,ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,This is where it all began – with a procedure in the parliament to establish its independence from Ukraine.,ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"By the way, the decision to hold this referendum was made by the Crimean parliament, which was elected in strict accordance with the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine before any such events.",ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"Incidentally, the same could be done in Ukraine in regard to Donbass.",ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"Then Ukraine would not have to limit the use of the languages ​​of foreign minorities, meaning not only Russian, but also Romanian, Hungarian and Polish.",ukraine

3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,This largely complicates the situation in Ukraine.,ukraine
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"But I will remind you – and these are the things very few people know about – that the ideologists of Ukrainian independence, Ukrainian nationalists insisted on creating a sovereign Ukrainian state, independent from Russia, as early as in the 19th century.",ukrainian
3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"But many of them also spoke about the need to maintain good relations with Russia, the need to form an independent Ukrainian state on federative principles, and so on.",ukrainian

3080,2018-06-04 22:00:00,"For us, for Russia, the important thing is that there would be no military facilities in Ukraine that could threaten our security, such as new missile defence systems aimed at thwarting our nuclear potential.",ukraine

3086,2018-06-07 16:30:00,"I would like to stress this again: the current Ukrainian authorities, especially in these circumstances, are unable to resolve the LPR and DPR problem, partly because they do not need voters from these regions, because it is clear that they would never vote for the current government.",ukrainian

3086,2018-06-07 16:30:00,I am thinking about something else though – that common sense should prevail in Ukraine.,ukraine

3167,2018-07-19 14:10:00,The reasons are the same as always: non-compliance of the Ukrainian authorities with their own commitments and refusal to settle the conflict peacefully.,ukrainian
3167,2018-07-19 14:10:00,"Our colleagues, who are trying to aggravate the situation, seeking to include, among others, Ukraine and Georgia in the orbit of the alliance, should think about the possible consequences of such an irresponsible policy.",ukraine

3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"But it is quite clear to everyone that the current Ukrainian authorities are not only shirking from implementing the Minsk Agreements but also have no intention to do this for the moment, including for domestic political reasons: I mean the approaching presidential and parliamentary elections.",ukrainian

3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"Let me again, though I am aware that this will fall on deaf ears, repeat a rhetorical question: Why were our Western partners, above all, the then leadership of the European Commission, pushing so hard for such a tough scenario involving Ukraine being dragged into this association with the European Union?",ukraine
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,What did it give Ukraine?,ukraine
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,They now want Ukraine to allow the export of round timber.,ukraine

3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"In return, they are forgiven for everything, because even in their wildest dreams our so-called partners would not envisage that Ukraine and Russia might cooperate in any way as they fear that competition in the world would grow as a result of such cooperation.",ukraine
3297,2018-10-18 17:50:00,"So, why was it necessary to cut open the Ukrainian markets without giving anything in return, while constantly pressing the Ukrainian government to raise domestic prices for energy, for gas, aware that the purchasing power of the population verges on zero?",ukrainian
3303,2018-10-22 17:00:00,"It was a city of central subordination, even when Crimea was transferred – illegally – from the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR.",ukrainian
3303,2018-10-22 17:00:00,"It is illegal because the decision was made by the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the RSFSR, Ukraine and then approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the USSR, while it should have been approved by the republics’ supreme councils and the USSR Supreme Council.",ukraine
3303,2018-10-22 17:00:00,"But even during this process, which was essentially illegal, everybody just forgot about Sevastopol, and it was not transferred from the USSR to Ukraine.",ukraine
3308,2018-10-24 19:15:00,"We also spoke about the Ukrainian crisis, which remains a pivotal issue and needs to be resolved.",ukrainian
3308,2018-10-24 19:15:00,"I would like to stress once again that they are not designed to be detrimental to the interests of any third parties, and do not target Ukraine’s interests.",ukraine

3323,2018-11-01 16:40:00,"So, we need additional natural gas not only from Nord Stream, but also gas delivered through Ukraine, in order to achieve our climate goals and provide Europe with competitive and clean fuel.",ukraine
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"Second, there is almost no point in meeting in the Normandy Format just now, during the election campaign in Ukraine, because, in fact, today’s regime in Ukraine has shown no desire yet to fulfil the Minsk Agreements.",ukraine
3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,Even the law on the special status of Donbass adopted by the Ukrainian parliament has not yet come into force.,ukrainian

3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"The trouble is that the Ukrainian authorities claim that some of those who are being kept in Ukrainian prisons and other facilities, sometimes without a court decision, are criminals who have been persecuted under Ukrainian laws.",ukrainian

3346,2018-11-15 12:20:00,"Regrettably, the incumbent President of Ukraine has not shown any desire to implement the Minsk Agreements.",ukraine
3359,2018-11-28 15:15:00,"As concerns the incident in the Black Sea, it was obviously a provocation organised by the current officials – I think, by the incumbent president, ahead of the presidential election in Ukraine to be held next March.",ukraine
3359,2018-11-28 15:15:00,"What about the painful civil war in southeastern Ukraine, in Donbass, in the Lugansk region, when government forces deployed tanks and heavy artillery, even aviation?",ukraine
3359,2018-11-28 15:15:00,"Look, last September roughly the same convoy of Ukrainian military ships passed through the Kerch Strait under the Kerch Bridge to the Sea of Azov.",ukrainian

3359,2018-11-28 15:15:00,This has nothing to do with the efforts being taken to put relations between Russia and Ukraine back on track.,ukraine
3359,2018-11-28 15:15:00,It will not lead to good things because it tends to unnerve today’s Ukrainian leadership in a way that it does not urge them to get down to normal political work within the country and start pursuing normal economic policy.,ukrainian
3359,2018-11-28 15:15:00,"As for long-term prospects, no matter what happens, no matter who is today in power in Kiev, the Russian and Ukrainian people have always been brotherly and very closely connected and will remain as such for ever.",ukrainian
3359,2018-11-28 15:15:00,"One day, the Ukrainian people will assess its today’s leadership in the way the Georgian people have assessed the activities of [Mikheil] Saakashvili.",ukrainian

3369,2018-12-01 23:30:00,"I already said and I want to repeat: even amid the events of a greater scale involving Ukraine, martial law was never introduced, but now, in the run-up to the elections, they found it indispensable to do so.",ukraine
3369,2018-12-01 23:30:00,Just think: this means that the current leadership of Ukraine has with its own hands divided the country in two parts – one trustworthy and the other not so much.,ukraine
3369,2018-12-01 23:30:00,"They cite some investigation by the Ukrainian official authorities, but there is no investigation.",ukrainian
3369,2018-12-01 23:30:00,"What especially troubles me is that analysis of recent events, this incident or the provocation in the Black Sea, or what we see in Donbass, suggests that the current leadership of Ukraine is actually not interested in resolving this crisis, let alone by peaceful means.",ukraine
3369,2018-12-01 23:30:00,This is the case when the situation both in our country and in Ukraine can be described by this proverb: “War makes some people rich”.,ukraine
3369,2018-12-01 23:30:00,"The external aggressor is to blame for the impoverishment of people, and for the state budget that can’t seem to make ends meet, so that Ukraine is compelled to go, hat in hand, to the IMF and other sponsors, shifting the responsibility and burden to future generations.",ukraine

4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,I would like to emphasise again that Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us.,ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"So, I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"Then, both before and after the Great Patriotic War, Stalin incorporated in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some lands that previously belonged to Poland, Romania and Hungary.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"In the process, he gave Poland part of what was traditionally German land as compensation, and in 1954, Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"In effect, this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"Actually, as I have already said, Soviet Ukraine is the result of the Bolsheviks’ policy and can be rightfully called “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine.”",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"This is fully and comprehensively corroborated by archival documents, including Lenin’s harsh instructions regarding Donbass, which was actually shoved into Ukraine.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,And today the “grateful progeny” has overturned monuments to Lenin in Ukraine.,ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,We are ready to show what real decommunizations would mean for Ukraine.,ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"It is now that radicals and nationalists, including and primarily those in Ukraine, are taking credit for having gained independence.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"This included our Ukrainian colleagues, who turned to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared independence.",ukrainian
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,Our country provided this assistance while respecting Ukraine’s dignity and sovereignty.,ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"According to expert assessments, confirmed by a simple calculation of our energy prices, the subsidised loans Russia provided to Ukraine along with economic and trade preferences, the overall benefit for the Ukrainian budget in the period from 1991 to 2013 amounted to $250 billion.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,An agreement to this effect was reached with Ukraine in December 1994.,ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"Nevertheless, despite all these challenges, Russia always worked with Ukraine in an open and honest manner and, as I have already said, with respect for its interests.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"Let me note that in 2019, that is before the pandemic, Ukraine’s trade with all EU countries combined was below this indicator.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"At the same time, it was striking how the Ukrainian authorities always preferred dealing with Russia in a way that ensured that they enjoy all the rights and privileges while remaining free from any obligations.",ukrainian
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"I can add that Kiev tried to use dialogue with Russia as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, using the threat of closer ties with Russia for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming that otherwise Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities – I would like to emphasise this – began by building their statehood on the negation of everything that united us, trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, of entire generations living in Ukraine.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism.",ukrainian
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,This resulted in the participation of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in the terrorist groups in the North Caucasus and the increasingly loud territorial claims to Russia.,ukrainian
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"A role in this was played by external forces, which used a ramified network of NGOs and special services to nurture their clients in Ukraine and to bring their representatives to the seats of authority.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,It should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood.,ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"And, therefore, in 1991 it opted for mindlessly emulating foreign models, which have no relation to history or Ukrainian realities.",ukrainian
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"Political government institutions were readjusted many times to the rapidly growing clans and their self-serving interests, which had nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people.",ukrainian
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"Essentially, the so-called pro-Western civilisational choice made by the oligarchic Ukrainian authorities was not and is not aimed at creating better conditions in the interests of people’s well-being but at keeping the billions of dollars that the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians and are holding in their accounts in Western banks, while reverently accommodating the geopolitical rivals of Russia.",ukrainian
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"They found it easy to force their will on the weak authorities, which were infected with the virus of nationalism and corruption as well and which artfully replaced the real cultural, economic and social interests of the people and Ukraine’s true sovereignty with various ethnic speculations and formal ethnic attributes.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"A stable statehood has never developed in Ukraine; its electoral and other political procedures just serve as a cover, a screen for the redistribution of power and property between various oligarchic clans.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"Corruption, which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries, including Russia, has gone beyond the usual scope in Ukraine.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"It has literally permeated and corroded Ukrainian statehood, the entire system, and all branches of power.",ukrainian

4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"Having accomplished a coup d'état, the nationalists and those political forces that supported them eventually led Ukraine into an impasse, pushed the country into the abyss of civil war.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,Ukraine is struggling with an acute socioeconomic crisis.,ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"According to international organisations, in 2019, almost 6 million Ukrainians – I emphasise – about 15 percent, not of the wokrforce, but of the entire population of that country, had to go abroad to find work.",ukrainian
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"There was a time, however, when not only Ukraine, but the entire Soviet Union took pride in these companies.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"It all came down to a Ukrainian economy in tatters and an outright pillage of the country’s citizens, while Ukraine itself was placed under external control, directed not only from the Western capitals, but also on the ground, as the saying goes, through an entire network of foreign advisors, NGOs and other institutions present in Ukraine.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"They have a direct bearing on all the key appointments and dismissals and on all branches of power at all levels, from the central government down to municipalities, as well as on state-owned companies and corporations, including Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Ukrainian Railways, Ukroboronprom, Ukrposhta, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority.",ukrainian

4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"As a result, the government, which designates itself as the “power of patriots” no longer acts in a national capacity and consistently pushes Ukraine towards losing its sovereignty.",ukraine

4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"It also sets out the contours of a potential war, which should end, according to the Kiev strategists, “with the assistance of the international community on favourable terms for Ukraine,” as well as – listen carefully, please – “with foreign military support in the geopolitical confrontation with the Russian Federation.”",ukraine

4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"In other words, acquiring tactical nuclear weapons will be much easier for Ukraine than for some other states I am not going to mention here, which are conducting such research, especially if Kiev receives foreign technological support.",ukraine

4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,"Furthermore, we are aware of the US leadership’s position and words that active hostilities in eastern Ukraine do not rule out the possibility of that country joining NATO if it meets NATO criteria and overcomes corruption.",ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,The information we have gives us good reason to believe that Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the subsequent deployment of NATO facilities has already been decided and is only a matter of time.,ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,Ukraine will serve as an advanced bridgehead for such a strike.,ukraine

4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,But they do exist and only because these people did not agree with the West-supported coup in Ukraine in 2014 and opposed the transition towards the Neanderthal and aggressive nationalism and neo-Nazism which have been elevated in Ukraine to the rank of national policy.,ukraine
4740,2022-02-21 22:35:00,Russia has done everything to preserve Ukraine’s territorial integrity.,ukraine

4741,2022-02-22 18:35:00,"I repeat, the situation with Ukraine is different, and this is related to the fact that the territory of this country is, unfortunately, used by third countries to create threats against the Russian Federation.",ukraine
4743,2022-02-22 19:40:00,Let us start with the Minsk agreements – the Minsk Package of Measures to settle the situation in southeastern Ukraine.,ukraine

4743,2022-02-22 19:40:00,"In fact, yesterday's event – the recognition of these republics – was dictated precisely by the fact that the Ukrainian leadership had publicly declared that they were not going to abide by these agreements.",ukrainian
4743,2022-02-22 19:40:00,"With regard to the borders within which we will recognise these republics, we did recognise them, which means we recognised their foundational documents, including the Constitution, and the Constitution stipulates their borders within the Donetsk and Lugansk regions at the time when they were part of Ukraine.",ukraine
4743,2022-02-22 19:40:00,We are categorically opposed to Ukraine joining NATO because this poses a threat to us and we have arguments to support this.,ukraine
4743,2022-02-22 19:40:00,"Therefore, the most important point is the demilitarisation, to a certain extent, of today’s Ukraine because it is the only factor that can be objectively controlled, monitored and responded to.",ukraine
4743,2022-02-22 19:40:00,"Everything else can change completely in either direction overnight, the way, for example, the current Ukrainian leader made the previous leader persona non grata by initiating criminal proceedings against him for his allegedly treacherous actions, because he disapproved of the Minsk agreements.",ukrainian
4743,2022-02-22 19:40:00,"This is totally unacceptable, particularly now, after Ukraine’s current authorities have declared their nuclear ambitions.",ukraine
4743,2022-02-22 19:40:00,"Ever since Soviet times, Ukraine has had fairly broad nuclear competencies, they have several nuclear power units and the nuclear industry is fairly well developed, they have dedicated schools, there is everything there to solve this issue much faster than in those countries which are solving matters from scratch.",ukraine

4743,2022-02-22 19:40:00,The appearance of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine is a strategic threat to us.,ukraine
4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,Any further expansion of the North Atlantic alliance’s infrastructure or the ongoing efforts to gain a military foothold of the Ukrainian territory are unacceptable for us.,ukrainian
4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,"We can see that the forces that staged the coup in Ukraine in 2014 have seized power, are keeping it with the help of ornamental election procedures and have abandoned the path of a peaceful conflict settlement.",ukraine
4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,"Focused on their own goals, the leading NATO countries are supporting the far-right nationalists and neo-Nazis in Ukraine, those who will never forgive the people of Crimea and Sevastopol for freely making a choice to reunite with Russia.",ukraine
4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,"They will undoubtedly try to bring war to Crimea just as they have done in Donbass, to kill innocent people just as members of the punitive units of Ukrainian nationalists and Hitler’s accomplices did during the Great Patriotic War.",ukrainian

4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory.,ukrainian
4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,Let me remind you that the people living in territories which are part of today’s Ukraine were not asked how they want to build their lives when the USSR was created or after World War II.,ukraine
4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,"We believe that all the peoples living in today’s Ukraine, anyone who want to do this, must be able to enjoy this right to make a free choice.",ukraine

4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,The current events have nothing to do with a desire to infringe on the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.,ukraine
4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,They are connected with the defending Russia from those who have taken Ukraine hostage and are trying to use it against our country and our people.,ukraine

4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,I will explain what this means: the military personnel of the Ukrainian army who do this will be able to freely leave the zone of hostilities and return to their families.,ukrainian
4745,2022-02-24 06:00:00,I want to emphasise again that all responsibility for the possible bloodshed will lie fully and wholly with the ruling Ukrainian regime.,ukrainian

4747,2022-02-25 17:45:00,"As expected, the Russian Army’s main armed clashes are taking place not with regular Ukrainian armed forces’ units but with nationalist groups that, as we know, bear direct responsibility for the genocide in Donbass and the spilled blood of the citizens of the people’s republics.",ukrainian
4747,2022-02-25 17:45:00,"Besides, the nationalist elements that infiltrated regular Ukrainian armed forces’ units are not only prompting them to armed resistance but are actually playing the role of anti-retreat units.",ukrainian

4747,2022-02-25 17:45:00,It seems it will be easier for us to come to terms with you than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that have settled in Kiev and that have taken the Ukrainian people hostage.,ukrainian

4754,2022-03-05 16:35:00,Our people can freely express their opinions of what they like or do not like about our actions in Ukraine.,ukraine
4754,2022-03-05 16:35:00,But in Ukraine those who express views such as members of the so-called liberal part of our society do are grabbed on the street and shot.,ukraine
4754,2022-03-05 16:35:00,"In our country, some of our liberal intellectuals hold protest rallies, but those who say similar things about Russia in Ukraine are simply executed straightaway, without charge or trial.",ukraine
4754,2022-03-05 16:35:00,We are hearing voices that a no-fly zone should be imposed over Ukraine.,ukraine
4754,2022-03-05 16:35:00,It is impossible to do this in Ukraine.,ukraine
4757,2022-03-10 17:55:00,"Everything that we are supposed to supply, we are supplying to our core consumers in Europe and other regions of the world in full; even the Ukrainian gas transit system is filled to 100 percent under our contracts.",ukrainian
4757,2022-03-10 17:55:00,It was complicated even before the events related to Ukraine.,ukraine
4758,2022-03-11 11:15:00,Regarding the mobilisation of mercenaries from all over the world and sending them to Ukraine.,ukraine
4758,2022-03-11 11:15:00,We can see that Ukraine’s Western sponsors and the Ukrainian regime are not concealing this fact.,ukraine
4759,2022-03-11 14:20:00,"I will certainly update you on Ukrainian developments and, above all, the progress of the negotiations, which are now being held almost on a daily basis.",ukrainian
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,We are meeting in a complicate period as our Armed Forces are conducting a special military operation in Ukraine and Donbass.,ukraine
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,"There was a network of dozens of laboratories in Ukraine, where military biological programmes were conducted under the guidance and with the financial support of the Pentagon, including experiments with coronavirus strains, anthrax, cholera, African swine fever and other deadly diseases.",ukraine
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,"However, we have grounds to assume that components of biological weapons were being created in direct proximity to Russia on the territory of Ukraine.",ukraine
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,Our numerous warnings that such developments posed a direct threat to the security of Russia were rejected with open and cynical arrogance by Ukraine and its US and NATO patrons.,ukraine
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,The movement of Russian forces against Kiev and other Ukrainian cities is not connected with a desire to occupy that country.,ukrainian
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,Our fellows – soldiers and officers – are displaying courage and heroism and are doing all they can to avoid civilian losses in Ukrainian cities.,ukrainian
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,"I must note that, encouraged by the United States and other Western countries, Ukraine was purposefully preparing for a scenario of force, a massacre and an ethnic cleansing in Donbass.",ukraine
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,We will certainly ensure the security of Russia and our people and will never allow Ukraine to be a bridgehead for aggressive actions against our country.,ukraine
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,"This includes Ukraine’s status as a neutral country, and demilitarisation and denazification.",ukraine
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,"But time and time again we see that the Kiev regime, which its Western handlers have charged with the task of creating an aggressive “anti-Russia” stance, does not care about the future of the people of Ukraine.",ukraine
4762,2022-03-16 18:10:00,"For the West, our military operation in Ukraine is just a pretext for imposing more sanctions on us.",ukraine
4763,2022-03-17 16:15:00,A new package of sanctions followed the start of the military operation in Ukraine.,ukraine
4764,2022-03-18 16:15:00,"The main goal and motive of the military operation that we launched in Donbass and Ukraine is to relieve these people of suffering, of this genocide.",ukraine
4769,2022-03-24 14:10:00,The meeting participants discussed at length the progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and expressed regret over the slowness of the Ukrainian side.,ukraine
4769,2022-03-24 14:10:00,"Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu     Shoigu SergeiDefence Minister  reported on the ongoing special military operation of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, as well as the efforts by the Russian military to provide humanitarian aid, ensure security and restore vital infrastructure in the liberated territories.",ukraine
4771,2022-03-27 00:00:00,I want to specially address the service personnel and staff of the National Guard units involved in the special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine.,ukraine
4778,2022-04-12 12:20:00,"We know that our officers are currently involved in the special military operation in Donbass, Ukraine, and that they are assisting the people’s republics of Donbass.",ukraine
4779,2022-04-12 12:30:00,"The President [of Ukraine] said that he did not like a single clause of the agreement, and other [Ukrainian] officials said that the agreements could not be implemented because they would destroy the country.",ukraine
4779,2022-04-12 12:30:00,"Second, Ukraine was being turned into a bridgehead, regrettably for us, into an anti-Russia bridgehead.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,Mr Lukashenko was informed in detail about the progress of the special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine and the progress of talks.,ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,A direct dialogue with the Ukrainian side was possible largely due to President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko’s personal efforts.,ukrainian
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"Also, however strange it may sound today, I have always said that we are a triune nation: Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,There is no doubt at all that is happening in Ukraine is a tragedy.,ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,The main thing is not the tragic events in Donbass and Ukraine; they are not the main thing.,ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,A lot is said about the United States being “ready to fight against Russia to the last Ukrainian.”,ukrainian
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"By fulfilling complicated and dangerous objectives in Donbass and Ukraine, our military personnel are protecting the interests of Russia and defending Russia.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"It is with good reason that the President of Belarus has said, and I said this even before the operation, that confrontation with the forces that have been nurtured by far-right nationalists and neo-Nazis in Ukraine was inevitable, and that it was only a matter of time.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"What is taking place in Ukraine, considering that Ukrainians are our fraternal people, something I want to stress even in these tragic circumstances, first of all, this Ukrainian nationalism originated back in the 19th century.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,And today we can see in Ukrainian newsreels people with SS Galicia sleeve patches in the combat zone in Donbass.,ukrainian
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"Actions in certain areas of Ukraine are only aimed at containing the enemy, strikes to destroy the military infrastructure and create conditions for more active operations on the territory of Donbass.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"Yes, occupation by Ukraine as well.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"After all, during preparations for World War I and during World War II, a certain segment of the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian society especially those linked with Western ideology, was against Russia.",ukrainian
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"However, they must also realise that the main goal of the West is not to help Ukraine.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,Ukraine is just a means to reaching goals that have nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people.,ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"This is what the problem is, and what determines the logic of our actions in Donbass and in Ukraine as a whole.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"With regard to the negotiations, look, we reached certain agreements in Istanbul, under which security guarantees for Ukraine – and the Ukrainian side is striving to obtain very strict security guarantees for itself – will not apply to Crimea, Sevastopol and Donbass.",ukraine
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,"In return, we saw the provocation in Bucha and, most importantly, the Ukrainian side walked away from the Istanbul agreements.",ukrainian
4781,2022-04-12 16:10:00,I was told that the Ukrainian side made some changes again last night.,ukrainian
4791,2022-04-20 18:45:00,"We have long noted this trend, even before the special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine began.",ukraine
4795,2022-04-25 14:00:00,"Colleagues, I would like to specifically discuss the tasks facing the prosecution agencies and the entire law enforcement sphere in connection with the special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine.",ukraine
4795,2022-04-25 14:00:00,The special operation has exposed multiple violations of international law by Ukrainian neo-Nazi groups as well as foreign mercenaries.,ukrainian
4795,2022-04-25 14:00:00,"To our surprise, high-ranking diplomats in Europe and the United States are urging their Ukrainian satellites to use their resources to win on the battlefield.",ukrainian
4795,2022-04-25 14:00:00,"In this regard, it should be noted of course that we know the names of all the Western handlers, of all members of Western services, primarily the CIA, who are working with Ukrainian security agencies.",ukrainian
4795,2022-04-25 14:00:00,"Let me emphasise that such evidence should be accumulated for all the crimes committed by neo-Nazis and their accomplices, starting with the coup d'état in Kiev in 2014, which paved the way for civil war, bloodshed and violence in Ukraine.",ukraine
4795,2022-04-25 14:00:00,"We should pay special attention to people arriving to Russia from Ukraine, from the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics.",ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"I know about your concern over Russia’s military operation in Donbass, in Ukraine.",ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,I would just like to note in this context that the entire problem emerged after a coup d’état staged in Ukraine in 2014.,ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"A similar problem emerged in south-eastern Ukraine, where the residents of several territories, at least, two Ukrainian regions, did not accept the coup d’état and its results.",ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"This is how the crisis in Donbass, in south-eastern Ukraine, emerged.",ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"Our Ukrainian colleagues did not link the requirements for Ukraine’s international security with such a notion as Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders, leaving aside Crimea, Sevastopol and the newly Russia-recognised Donbass republics, albeit with certain reservations.",ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"After this, the position of our negotiators from Ukraine on a further settlement underwent a drastic change.",ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"(In his remarks, the UN Secretary General expressed concern over the situation in Ukraine, while emphasising the need for a multilateral world order based on the UN Charter and international law.",ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"These proposals concern humanitarian matters, including humanitarian corridors, in particular, for Mariupol residents, as well as setting up a humanitarian contact group in which the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Russia, and Ukraine would work together to discuss the situation in order to make these corridors truly safe and effective.)",ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"If so, the Donbass republics, the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic, can enjoy the same right without seeking permission from Ukraine’s central government and declare their sovereignty, since the precedent has been created.",ukraine
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,Part of the Ukrainian armed forces that were deployed in other industrial districts have surrendered.,ukrainian
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"Yes, the Ukrainian authorities say that there are civilians at the plant.",ukrainian
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"In this case, the Ukrainian military must release them, or otherwise they will be doing what terrorists in many countries have done, what ISIS did in Syria when they used civilians as human shields.",ukrainian
4800,2022-04-26 20:10:00,"Over 100,000 people, 130,000–140,000, if I remember correctly, have left Mariupol with our assistance, and they are free to go where they want, to Russia or Ukraine.",ukraine
4801,2022-04-27 16:45:00,"They placed their bets on Russophobia and neo-Nazis and were impudently, unceremoniously turning our neighbor Ukraine into an “anti-Russia” year after year.",ukraine
4801,2022-04-27 16:45:00,"I would like to recall that when Russia had a benevolent, I would say, a friendly, comradely, fraternal attitude to the creation of an independent Ukrainian state, we thought, of course, that it would be a friendly state, that we could go further together, strengthening and developing each other and creating the most competitive conditions for progress – yes, in new and historical conditions.",ukrainian
4801,2022-04-27 16:45:00,"Ukraine was pushed into direct confrontation with Russia, our country.",ukraine
4801,2022-04-27 16:45:00,"Let me remind you that this was, unfortunately, all laid out, including an armed attack on Crimea and Donbass, in Ukraine’s doctrinal documents of today, while at the same time, the Ukrainian people were allotted the destiny of “expendable material.”",ukraine
4801,2022-04-27 16:45:00,I believe a large part of the Ukrainian people are coming to realise this.,ukrainian
4801,2022-04-27 16:45:00,"The entire course of recent events, including the Kiev regime’s claims to possess nuclear weapons, the deployment of a network of Western biolabs on Ukrainian territory, the seamless supplies of cutting-edge weapons to Ukraine, has confirmed that our reaction to those cynical plans was correct and timely.",ukraine
4801,2022-04-27 16:45:00,"Speaking at a Prosecutor General's Office Board meeting the day before yesterday, I mentioned the need to create a detailed and incontrovertible evidence base covering all the heinous crimes and violations of international humanitarian law committed by the neo-Nazis and foreign mercenaries who are arriving in Ukraine in great numbers.",ukraine
4801,2022-04-27 16:45:00,But it is no secret that such methods – killing their own journalists and politicians right on the street – have been used quite often in Ukraine in recent years.,ukraine
4816,2022-05-16 18:00:00,"Now, during the special operation in Ukraine, documentary evidence was obtained that components of biological weapons were developed in close proximity to our borders, which violates the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, and possible methods and mechanisms were worked out to destabilise the epidemiological situation in the post-Soviet space.",ukraine
4816,2022-05-16 18:00:00,"Unfortunately, in our neighbouring country, Ukraine, neo-Nazism has been on the rise for a long time now, to which some of our partners from the “collective West” turn a blind eye, and thus actually encourage their activities.",ukraine
4816,2022-05-16 18:00:00,"But unfortunately, this is happening in Ukraine.",ukraine
4816,2022-05-16 18:00:00,"As for Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, we will certainly discuss this, and I will inform you in detail about its causes and the current combat effort.",ukraine
4820,2022-05-17 16:00:00,"By the way, everything that happens in this area, including, unfortunately, everything around Ukraine, is related to the ill-considered policy of the so-called collective West, which for decades ignored Russia’s justified security concerns, and in every possible way fostered nationalist and neo-Nazi elements in the Kiev leadership, neglected problems that were taking shape in Ukraine’s southeast, and, in fact, for the past eight years facilitated the ongoing hostilities that were launched by the Kiev regime eight years ago.",ukraine
4824,2022-05-20 15:50:00,"But since the special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine, challenges in this sphere have become even more serious and critical.",ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"First, the situation with the global food market did not become worse yesterday or even with the launch of Russia’s special military operation in Donbass, in Ukraine.",ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"So, it was a mistake made by the US financial and economic authorities – it has nothing to do with Russia's actions in Ukraine, it is totally unrelated.",ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,Now we are being told that Ukraine is ready to export 20 million tonnes.,ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"But if we proceed from the fact that wheat accounts for merely 20 percent of all food products in the world – and this is the case, this is not our data, it comes from the UN – this means that these 20 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat are just 0.5 percent, practically nothing.",ukrainian
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,20 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat are potential exports.,ukrainian
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"Today, the US official bodies also say that Ukraine could export six million tonnes of wheat.",ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"As for shipping out Ukrainian grain, we are not preventing this.",ukrainian
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"You can ship it out via the Ukraine-controlled ports, primarily in the Black Sea – Odessa and nearby ports.",ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,We did not mine the approaches to the port – Ukraine did this.,ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,They must clear the mines and raise the ships they sunk on purpose in the Black Sea to make it difficult to enter the ports to the south of Ukraine.,ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"There is another opportunity: the ports in the Sea of Azov – Berdyansk and Mariupol – are under our control, and we are ready to ensure a problem-free exit from these ports, including for exported Ukrainian grain.",ukrainian
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"We are completing this work – at one time, Ukrainian troops laid three layers of mines.",ukrainian
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,It is possible to move grain from Ukraine via the Danube and through Romania.,ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"At any rate, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko puts it like this: if someone wants to resolve the problem of exporting Ukrainian grain, if this problem exists at all, please use the simplest way – through Belarus.",ukrainian
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"So, the problem of shipping grain out of Ukraine does not really exist.",ukraine
4838,2022-06-03 20:00:00,"By the way, several ships are stuck in Ukrainian ports at this point.",ukrainian
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,As for Ukrainian food supplies to global markets – I have to mention this because of numerous speculations – we are not hindering them.,ukrainian
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,We did not mine the Black Sea ports of Ukraine.,ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,"Anyway, Ukrainian grain can be exported, and not only via Black Sea ports.",ukrainian
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,"The West not only sought to implement an “anti-Russia” scenario, but also engaged in the active military development of Ukrainian territory, flooding Ukraine with weapons and military advisers.",ukraine

4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,Why stage a coup in Ukraine in 2014?,ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,"Three foreign ministers from three European countries – Germany, France and Poland – came to Ukraine to attend, as guarantors, the ceremony for signing agreements between then President Yanukovych and the opposition.",ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,"In addition, they started creating an anti-Russian foothold in Ukraine.",ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,Whether it will benefit Ukraine or not is also a concern only of the Ukrainian people and the country’s leadership.,ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,The structure of the Ukrainian economy requires very large subsidies and support.,ukrainian
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,"If Ukraine fails to protect its domestic market it will completely turn into a semi-colony, in my opinion.",ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,I have written and stated publicly before that over the past decades Ukraine sent down the drain everything that was created in the preceding decades.,ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,The problem lies with the structure of the economy in Ukraine.,ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,Can EU accession provide a new impetus to developing key sectors in Ukraine?,ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,"The people of Ukraine are certainly talented, and they have impressive potential.",ukraine

4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,When did the problem of 2014 and the coup in Ukraine emerge?,ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,This happened because former President Viktor Yanukovich said that he needed to think about the principles for Ukraine’s association with the EU.,ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,"If you open and read specific principles and requirements for Ukraine’s association, you will see that they are completely excessive.",ukraine

4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,We would have treated Ukraine the same way.,ukraine
4850,2022-06-17 17:40:00,"And by the way, there would be no problem with Crimea either, because if Ukraine had respected the rights of the people who live there, the Russian-speaking population, the Russian language and culture, this would never have occurred to anyone, don’t you see?",ukraine
