1009,2014-05-21 15:40:00,"We should note too that, first, now that the contract has been signed, work will begin immediately, and second, this gives us the chance to start work on our next project with our Chinese partners, namely, planning a western supply route from the resource base in Western Siberia.",chinese,[]
1009,2014-05-21 15:40:00,"The final price will be calculated using this formula, and this satisfies Gazprom and our Chinese partners.",chinese,[]

1012,2014-05-23 14:30:00,"This is what we refer to as the Eastern Route from Eastern Siberia, but we agreed with our Chinese friends that the Western Route with the resource base in Western Siberia will be the focus of our next phase.",chinese,[]
1013,2014-05-23 16:45:00,"Just the other day, top-level talks between Russia and China ended.",china,[]

1013,2014-05-23 16:45:00,"China, on its part, plans to invest $20-$22 billion in their infrastructure.",china,[]

1013,2014-05-23 16:45:00,"I will agree with our Chinese colleague who said that even with the advanced level of Russia-China relations we had before, with the signing of these documents and the agreements we reached during this visit, our relations with China are indeed entering a higher and qualitatively different stage.",china,['russia']
1013,2014-05-23 16:45:00,"Of course, we are thankful to our Chinese partners and President of China Xi Jinping for his personal contribution to these issues.",china,[]
1013,2014-05-23 16:45:00,"Speaking of our plans with China – and I’m not mentioning gas although, as I said, it will be the largest construction site in the world, with $55 billion invested by Gazprom alone – these include construction of a helium plant, a plant for the chemical utilisation of natural gas and infrastructure.",china,[]
1013,2014-05-23 16:45:00,"But generally, I hope, despite occasional problems, that humankind will have enough common sense, and that experience of the past decades and even centuries, including tragic experience (our colleague from China mentioned that we are approaching the 70th anniversary of the Second World War and the anniversary of the First World War), will eventually encourage the world to resolve any disputes through negotiations that would take into account interest of the parties.",china,[]
1014,2014-05-23 18:15:00,The Chinese government’s position on key development issues is of considerable importance for everyone taking part in the Forum and everyone who is following closely the global economy’s development.,chinese,[]

1014,2014-05-23 18:15:00,"Of course, the Russian and Chinese governments played key roles here because it would have been impossible to reach agreements without first resolving some key issues that come under the governments’ responsibility.",chinese,[]
1014,2014-05-23 18:15:00,"I am very grateful of course to President of the People’s Republic of China and my friend Mr Xi Jinping, who took personal interest in all of the issues discussed during our negotiations.",china,[]
1014,2014-05-23 18:15:00,The Chinese are very serious negotiators.,chinese,[]
1014,2014-05-23 18:15:00,Vice President of the People’S Republic of China Li Yuanchao (retranslated):,china,[]

1014,2014-05-23 18:15:00,Please pass on my best wishes to President of China Xi Jinping.,china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,The meetings in Shanghai several days ago and the documents that were signed prove without any doubt that relations between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation have advanced to a new level.,china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"For the People’s Republic of China, this contract is expected to reduce energy deficit, which is also crucial.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"As I said yesterday, we share the concerns of China’s leaders regarding the need for reducing air pollution in major cities.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,We really hope that our cooperation will help improve the environment in major Chinese cities.,chinese,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"The first contract is about delivering gas to the eastern part of China, while the second contract could target the west.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"Since all the main issues regarding price calculation, price formation and government support and benefits for this project have already been addressed by both sides, the second project, if greenlighted by China, could be implemented even faster than the Eastern Route project.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"Of course, it will all depend on the People’s Republic of China and its need to develop specific regions.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,Joining efforts on monetary and financial issues is very important for both China and Russia.,china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,There is no secret that the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation have large foreign currency reserves.,china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,China ranks first globally in this respect.,china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,I would like to commend the President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping on the special role he played in facilitating these agreements.,china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"As for our relations with our Chinese partners and friends, and our relations with our European partners, including Germany – once we begin executing our contract with China, that country will become an equal consumer of Russian gas, just like Germany.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"Russia will supply similar volumes of the fuel to both customers: Germany currently consumes about 40 billion cubic metres of Russian gas annually, and China will buy around 40 billion too.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"Yet, if we implement the so-called second project with China, where Russian gas will be shipped to them along the Western Route, China will become our largest gas partner.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"I already said that it would be the biggest construction project with Russian investment, totalling $55 billion, and with our Chinese partners contributing another $20 billion to build the facilities on their end.",chinese,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,The second distribution route is only being discussed with our Chinese colleagues.,chinese,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"As for the planned supplies to China over the Western Route, we have not agreed on this yet, but the volume will certainly be less than 200 billion cubic metres.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"The additional 200 billion cubic metres of gas we can produce will certainly be enough to supply to China and to increase supplies to our European consumers, and even to meet the growing needs of the Russian economy.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,We’ve already said this – both Chinese President Xi Jinping and me – that we don’t make friends against someone else.,chinese,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,Russia has its own relations with Japan and China has its ties with Japan as well.,china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"Incidentally, your Chinese colleague said we should commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.",chinese,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"I consider it absolutely counterproductive to juxtapose our relations with any country, including China, to ties with third states.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,"Let me assure you that China, for all the complications in its relations with Japan, is developing them itself.",china,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,It has simply never occurred to us – either us or the Chinese – to set some conditions for each other in developing bilateral relations.,chinese,[]
1020,2014-05-24 18:30:00,Both we and our Chinese friends behave exclusively as partners.,chinese,[]
1031,2014-05-29 12:20:00,Belarus and Kazakhstan together come in third in the overall trade balance of the Russian Federation (after the EU and China).,china,[]
1031,2014-05-29 12:20:00,"However, let us compare: our trade turnover with the EU is 440 billion, and with China it is 87.",china,[]
1031,2014-05-29 12:20:00,"We agreed to step up our negotiations, as I already said, with Vietnam on creating a free trade zone, to strengthen cooperation with the People’s Republic of China, specifically in the exchange of customs information on goods and services, and to form expert groups that would work out preferential trade regimes with Israel and India.",china,[]
1034,2014-05-30 12:30:00,"Looking to the next steps, this work would involve doing as Japan and China did and having the national payment system sign agreements with foreign partners and gradually moving into the foreign market too.",china,[]
1039,2014-06-04 21:10:00,The agreements signed during the recent Russian-Chinese talks were clear evidence of this.,chinese,['russian']
1039,2014-06-04 21:10:00,I have already said that this gas pipeline system is certain to expand following the signing of a long-term gas contract with China.,china,[]
1043,2014-06-06 21:00:00,"And moreover, we have an agreement with our Chinese friends and partners that they are prepared to make advance payments, in essence, and reduce the cost of this project significantly.",chinese,[]
1059,2014-06-23 18:15:00,So it was in Gatchina?,china,[]
1061,2014-06-24 20:00:00,"Just recently, we signed a contract with the People’s Republic of China.",china,[]
1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,We need to strengthen overall partnership and strategic cooperation with the People’s Republic of China.,china,[]
1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,We can say that a strong Russian-Chinese connection has taken shape on the international arena.,chinese,['russian']
1070,2014-07-01 15:45:00,It is of primary importance that Russian-Chinese friendship is not directed against anyone: we are not creating any military unions.,chinese,['russian']
1077,2014-07-07 13:30:00,"We were behind the United States and China, weren’t we?",china,[]
1094,2014-07-15 01:00:00,and China's principled position on Syria in the Security Council the events in that country would have followed the Libyan and Iraqi scenario.,china,[]
1095,2014-07-15 03:10:00,"Mr President, my friend, and Chinese friends, I am very happy to see you – this time, on the sidelines of the BRICS summit.",chinese,[]
1095,2014-07-15 03:10:00,I was recalling my visit to China.,china,[]
1095,2014-07-15 03:10:00,"You know, I want to say that I liked going to China, particularly with such results.",china,[]
1095,2014-07-15 03:10:00,"If you do not mind, I would like to come again in November, this time to work within the framework of APEC, whose summit China will be hosting.",china,[]
1095,2014-07-15 03:10:00,We are working very intensively and feel your personal attention toward the development of Russian-Chinese relations and reaching results.,chinese,['russian']
1097,2014-07-15 22:45:00,"It is thanks to Russia and China’s firm stance in the UN Security Council, with support from other BRICS participants, that we were able to rally most international dialogue participants – including the European Union and the United States – and prevent a foreign invasion in Syria, achieving the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons.",china,[]
1097,2014-07-15 22:45:00,"Russia, Brazil, India, China and South Africa already account for 11% of accumulated investment and nearly 20% of global trade.",china,[]
1100,2014-07-17 02:00:00,"In particular, I want to note the gas supply agreement that you signed with China.",china,[]
1101,2014-07-17 02:30:00,"Moreover, this will be a world-class seaport and China will certainly participate.",china,[]
1101,2014-07-17 02:30:00,It is very important for China to work in our market.,china,[]
1102,2014-07-17 03:30:00,"Only recently, in 2005, when we were hosting the G8 summit in St Petersburg, we proposed to our Chinese and Indian friends for the first time to get together.",chinese,[]
1102,2014-07-17 03:30:00,"It is only making its first steps, while there is no need to say much about its member-states: India, China and 200 million people in Brazil.",china,[]
1131,2014-08-14 16:15:00,"Meanwhile, North Korea, the People’s Republic of China, Pakistan, India, Israel, Iran – almost all the countries in the world are working on this type of weapons.",china,[]
1131,2014-08-14 16:15:00,"So, the development of these missiles in China or India does not cause any concern to us, because these are friendly states and I am certain that the relations we have established with China and India will last, bearing in mind the peculiarities of international relations and prospects for their development.",china,[]
1131,2014-08-14 16:15:00,"Say, we are working on an agreement with the People’s Republic of China to trade in rubles and yuans – not an easy process.",china,[]
1131,2014-08-14 16:15:00,"This means that Russia, China, Brazil, South Africa and India should all allocate part of their contingent reserves to this arrangement.",china,[]
1138,2014-08-26 16:30:00,"At some stage, we were simply told that this was none of our business, that they do not, for instance, discuss our relations with China or Canada.",china,[]
1138,2014-08-26 16:30:00,"However, let us bear in mind that China and Canada are far away, while economic relations between Russia and Ukraine are a completely different story.",china,[]
1148,2014-09-01 14:00:00,But I know that you are not just the Vice Premier and a member of China’s Politburo.,china,[]
1148,2014-09-01 14:00:00,"But this depends to a great extent on professionals such as yourself in China, in Russiaand in our partners’ countries.",china,[]
1148,2014-09-01 14:00:00,"Overall, we take a cautious approach to letting in our foreign partners, but we of course set no restrictions for our Chinese friends.",chinese,[]
1149,2014-09-01 14:10:00,"Friends, Chinese partners, We are celebrating a happy event today – the start of a project that we had been talking about for a long time.",chinese,[]
1149,2014-09-01 14:10:00,We and our Chinese friends were saying just before that this marks the start of the world’s biggest construction project.,chinese,[]
1149,2014-09-01 14:10:00,"What’s important is not setting records though, but that this project has great significance for the Russian Federation and for the People’s Republic of China.",china,[]
1149,2014-09-01 14:10:00,It is the high level of cooperation between Russia and China that has made this project possible.,china,[]

4443,2021-06-14 16:00:00,"That is why what you said, that China won't engage in negotiations on arms control, it refuses to negotiate reductions in nuclear offensive weapons.",china,[]
4443,2021-06-14 16:00:00,"You should ask the Chinese about it, whether it's good or bad.",chinese,[]
4443,2021-06-14 16:00:00,"But their arguments are simple and understandable: in terms of the amount of ammunition and warheads and delivery vehicles, the United States and Russia are far, far ahead of China.",china,[]
4443,2021-06-14 16:00:00,"And the Chinese justly say, ”Why would we make reductions if we are already far behind what you have?",chinese,[]

4443,2021-06-14 16:00:00,"I believe that this is sufficient, and I'm confident that the Chinese leadership being aware of the totality of these matters, including the part of their population who are Uyghurs, will find the necessary solution to make sure that the situation remains stable and benefits the entire multi-million-strong Chinese people, including its Uyghur part.",chinese,[]
